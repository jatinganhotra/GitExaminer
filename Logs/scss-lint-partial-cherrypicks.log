Commit message - Fix Shorthand linter false positives

For properties with names beginning with a shorthandable property (like
`border-color` or `margin`) followed by interpolation, the `Shorthand`
linter would report a lint if that property had values that were not in
the most condensed form.

These lints were erroneous because since the lint was basically being
triggered due to the prefix of the property name. Since the
interpolation cannot be determined statically, it's possible that it
would resolve to a property that did not support shorthand values.

Fix the bug by checking the entire property name, not just the prefix.

In the process the code was cleaned up a bit, since Code Climate
indicated that the `visit_prop` method had a high cyclomatic complexity
due to the nesting in the case statement.

Commit message - Split PropertyFormat into separate linters

The `PropertyFormat` linter suffered from bugs due to the brittle regex
it employed to check the format of the property declaration. This regex
also attempted to test too much, making the error message in the event
of a lint being discovered not terribly useful.

Split out the `PropertyFormat` linter into three separate linters:

  * `SpaceAfterPropertyColon`
    Prefers `margin: 0;` instead of `margin:0;`

  * `SpaceAfterPropertyName`
    Prefers `margin: 0;` instead of `margin : 0;`

  * `TrailingSemiColonAfterProperty`
    Ensures the final property in a rule set has a trailing semi-colon

These linters are simpler thanks to the support for being able to query
source ranges on all Sass parse tree nodes, and no longer require the
use of a brittle regex.

Commit message - Add extra_properties option to PropertySpelling

There are a lot of CSS properties, and the lack of a definitive list (as
well as the constant introduction of new experimental properties) makes
it impractical to ensure our list is up-to-date at any given time.

To address this, add an `extra_properties` config option to the
`PropertySpelling` linter so that developers can add additional
properties to the whitelist without needing to submit a pull request.

Commit message - Ignore interpolation in SingleLinePerSelector

The `SingleLinePerSelector` linter would incorrectly report lints when
selector contained interpolation with a comma in it, e.g.

    .my-#{function(1, 2)}-selector .item {
    }

The solution is to ignore the content of any interpolation, as it has no
bearing on what the linter is trying to check.

In the process I also updated the linter to not define a `description`
method, as this style of linter declaration should go away in favour of
explicitly passing messages to `add_lint`.

Fixes #67

Commit message - Fix Indentation linter with at-root inline selectors

Due to the way the Sass parser creates the parse tree for `@at-root`
directives, the following two pieces of code produce the same parse
tree:

    @at-root {
      .something {
        ...
      }
    }

    @at-root .something {
      ...
    }

This was resulting in erroneous lints being reported in the
`Indentation` linter, since it couldn't tell which case was which given
the parse tree.

We can use a nasty hack of checking if the end position of the
`@at-root` node matches the start position of its first child, in which
case we know the child is inline instead of being properly nested.

This was resulting in erroneous lints being reported in the
`Indentation` linter, since it couldn't tell which case was which given
the parse tree.

We can use a nasty hack of checking if the end position of the
`@at-root` node matches the start position of its first child, in which
case we know the child is inline instead of being properly nested.

Commit message - Fix Indentation linter handling of comments

The `Indentation` linter would error on SCSS where a comment preceded
another line of code, e.g.

    // A comment
    $var: 1;

This was caused by the code not checking if the `source_range` was set
for that node, which is the case for comment nodes (they only return a
value for `line`).

Commit message - Fix Shorthand linter false positives

For properties with names beginning with a shorthandable property (like
`border-color` or `margin`) followed by interpolation, the `Shorthand`
linter would report a lint if that property had values that were not in
the most condensed form.

These lints were erroneous because since the lint was basically being
triggered due to the prefix of the property name. Since the
interpolation cannot be determined statically, it's possible that it
would resolve to a property that did not support shorthand values.

Fix the bug by checking the entire property name, not just the prefix.

In the process the code was cleaned up a bit, since Code Climate
indicated that the `visit_prop` method had a high cyclomatic complexity
due to the nesting in the case statement.

Commit message - Split PropertyFormat into separate linters

The `PropertyFormat` linter suffered from bugs due to the brittle regex
it employed to check the format of the property declaration. This regex
also attempted to test too much, making the error message in the event
of a lint being discovered not terribly useful.

Split out the `PropertyFormat` linter into three separate linters:

  * `SpaceAfterPropertyColon`
    Prefers `margin: 0;` instead of `margin:0;`

  * `SpaceAfterPropertyName`
    Prefers `margin: 0;` instead of `margin : 0;`

  * `TrailingSemiColonAfterProperty`
    Ensures the final property in a rule set has a trailing semi-colon

These linters are simpler thanks to the support for being able to query
source ranges on all Sass parse tree nodes, and no longer require the
use of a brittle regex.

Commit message - Add extra_properties option to PropertySpelling

There are a lot of CSS properties, and the lack of a definitive list (as
well as the constant introduction of new experimental properties) makes
it impractical to ensure our list is up-to-date at any given time.

To address this, add an `extra_properties` config option to the
`PropertySpelling` linter so that developers can add additional
properties to the whitelist without needing to submit a pull request.

Commit message - Ignore interpolation in SingleLinePerSelector

The `SingleLinePerSelector` linter would incorrectly report lints when
selector contained interpolation with a comma in it, e.g.

    .my-#{function(1, 2)}-selector .item {
    }

The solution is to ignore the content of any interpolation, as it has no
bearing on what the linter is trying to check.

In the process I also updated the linter to not define a `description`
method, as this style of linter declaration should go away in favour of
explicitly passing messages to `add_lint`.

Fixes #67

Commit message - Ignore color keywords in HexFormat linter

The `HexFormat` linter would fail on CSS color keywords, e.g. `gold` or
`orange`. This was due to the fact that the `original` value of the
`Color` object would not be set for colors specified via keyword. This
would only happen for color keywords that appear in Sass script however
(not color keywords that appear as normal property values, as those
don't get created as `Color` objects by the parser).

The solution was to check that `original` was defined before attempting
to run the lint.

Commit message - Upgrade sass from 3.2.10 -> 3.3.0.rc.1

This is an important change that adds a lot of extra plumbing for
accessing the start and ending lines/columns (source range) of a parsed
node. It also sets us up for continuing to support the latest version of
Sass going forward.

Unfortunately, this resulted in a lot of the class hierarchy being
shuffled around, and a change in the behavior of some interfaces.

At a high level:

 * `Sass::Script::Node` -> `Sass::Script::Tree::Node`

 * `Sass::Script::Literal` -> `Sass::Script::Tree::Literal`, and now
   wraps `Sass::Script::Value::Base` objects

 * We no longer need the hack to return the original name of the
   variable in keyword arg lists (see 8b1f5909)

 * Nodes that span multiple lines now report the first line as their
   `line` rather than the last line. This also means the
   `node_start_line` hack is no longer needed, and was removed (see
   6a5d338a).

 * A bunch of specs were updated as the lines being reported for
   multiline nodes are now the first line instead of the last

 * `EachNode` now has `vars` attribute instead of just a single `var`

There's still some fallout that will need to be figured out (ideally,
we'll try to remove some of the `original_string` hacks), but those will
come later.

This change was brought to you by specs, because without them it would
have been virtually impossible.

Commit message - Downgrade colorize from 0.6.0 -> 0.5.8

This dependency was upgraded in 431ce29 with the thought that there were
no breaking changes.

It turns out that it actually removed the automatic disabling of
colorization when the terminal was not a TTY. This resulted in
`scss-lint` printing color escape sequences even when it was being
output to a file.

This is obviously not ideal. Since there are no significant reasons to
upgrade to 0.6.0, downgrade back down to 0.5.8.

Commit message - Fix Shorthand linter false positives

For properties with names beginning with a shorthandable property (like
`border-color` or `margin`) followed by interpolation, the `Shorthand`
linter would report a lint if that property had values that were not in
the most condensed form.

These lints were erroneous because since the lint was basically being
triggered due to the prefix of the property name. Since the
interpolation cannot be determined statically, it's possible that it
would resolve to a property that did not support shorthand values.

Fix the bug by checking the entire property name, not just the prefix.

In the process the code was cleaned up a bit, since Code Climate
indicated that the `visit_prop` method had a high cyclomatic complexity
due to the nesting in the case statement.

Commit message - Split PropertyFormat into separate linters

The `PropertyFormat` linter suffered from bugs due to the brittle regex
it employed to check the format of the property declaration. This regex
also attempted to test too much, making the error message in the event
of a lint being discovered not terribly useful.

Split out the `PropertyFormat` linter into three separate linters:

  * `SpaceAfterPropertyColon`
    Prefers `margin: 0;` instead of `margin:0;`

  * `SpaceAfterPropertyName`
    Prefers `margin: 0;` instead of `margin : 0;`

  * `TrailingSemiColonAfterProperty`
    Ensures the final property in a rule set has a trailing semi-colon

These linters are simpler thanks to the support for being able to query
source ranges on all Sass parse tree nodes, and no longer require the
use of a brittle regex.

Commit message - Add extra_properties option to PropertySpelling

There are a lot of CSS properties, and the lack of a definitive list (as
well as the constant introduction of new experimental properties) makes
it impractical to ensure our list is up-to-date at any given time.

To address this, add an `extra_properties` config option to the
`PropertySpelling` linter so that developers can add additional
properties to the whitelist without needing to submit a pull request.

Commit message - Ignore interpolation in SingleLinePerSelector

The `SingleLinePerSelector` linter would incorrectly report lints when
selector contained interpolation with a comma in it, e.g.

    .my-#{function(1, 2)}-selector .item {
    }

The solution is to ignore the content of any interpolation, as it has no
bearing on what the linter is trying to check.

In the process I also updated the linter to not define a `description`
method, as this style of linter declaration should go away in favour of
explicitly passing messages to `add_lint`.

Fixes #67
