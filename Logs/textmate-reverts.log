Commit message - Simplify constraints used to layout document window

We now do the core layout with priorities that allow optional elements to insert themselves between existing elements.
---> The original commit sha is - 26dfefc7d54d2b14fdb8320f6e6e69f2cebb08eb
Commit message - Revert "Simplify constraints used to layout document window"

This reverts commit 9a85ff2d5722b68ef7ed1f36910119d538da86bc.

The problem with priorities (less than required) is that it allows for the constraint to not be satisfied, which could cause the document view to overlap file browser (or be cut by window’s content view) when the size available for the document view was less than its fitting size.

Commit message - Remove non-UTF-8 from clipboard data

It should be safe to assume that clipboard data is valid UTF-8, but I’m seeing crashes related to creating a CFString (from buffer content) after a paste operation, so the assumption might not be valid.

Commit message - Variables set via requiredCommands are now shell escaped

Additionally we expect that any variable the user has set is properly shell escaped. Though this is only relevant if the value contains spaces or escape characters.

Currently bundle commands has not been updated to assume that the variables are already shell escaped, so this commit can cause issues with existing bundles.

Commit message - Use custom script to simulate “codesign --deep”

The problem is that with a bad internet connection there is a very high probability that “codesign --deep” will fail due to having to contact the timestamp server for each embedded executable object.

Long-term we probably want to sign the sub-targets as they are produced and/or link the entire thing together so that there is only a single sign target (plus embedded plug-ins).

Commit message - Don’t use GCD for regexp matching

Using GCD actually makes the code slower — it might have to do with locking overhead from std::shared_ptr and onig_region_new/region_free.

Worth trying again once use of std::shared_ptr has been removed from the parser, and oniguruma regions are preallocated.

---> The original commit sha is - 17bdfd0ad721ac8598089eab0acc915c163badf3

Several people dislike the change (see issue #893) and the commit didn’t introduce new functionality per se: full path searching is still available when explicitly typing a slash.

This means that the signature will be invalid when the certificate expires, though it also means that codesign runs faster, and as my certificate is valid for another 4 years, people shouldn’t be using the builds released today when the certificate expires.

Commit message - Don’t refresh gutter from OakTextView

I suspect that this was added because some operations were not properly detected, though the only thing I can find, that doesn’t properly update the gutter, is when deleting folded code in a way that doesn’t change the bounds of the text view. This code however does not address that issue.

Commit message - Revert "Don’t refresh gutter from OakTextView"

Turns out this is required in the situation where the document occupy less space than the visible document rect.

In this case, inserting new lines will not resize the text view, since it has been artificially enlarged to fit the visible document rect, therefore the gutter view will not update properly when inserting new lines.

I think there is a better solution than have the text view refresh the gutter, reverting is just meant as a quick fix.
