# ---------------------- HOW TO Run ------------------------------
# ----------------------------------------------------------------

1. Clone the Project repository by
        git clone https://github.com/silverSpoon/GitExaminer.git
2. Run the project on a git repository by providing it
    a) the local git repository path
            ruby script.rb tests/test1
    b) or, pass the repository remote URL, e.g.
            ruby script.rb https://github.com/nikolaypavlov/MLPNeuralNet

    Execution steps:
    1. If input argument is repo remote URL, the project is cloned into the /tmp directory.
    2. Perform all the analysis
    3. Log the results into the respective files for reverts, merges, partial cherry-picks etc.
       in the Logs/ directory.
    4. Cleanup. Delete the cloned repository from /tmp

While executing and performing the analysis, information regarding the repository is printed
and also the progress in also printed to the screen, which tells how many commits have been
processed while looking for reverts, cherrypicks etc.

A typical execution run looks like:
â‡’  ruby script.rb https://github.com/nikolaypavlov/MLPNeuralNet
