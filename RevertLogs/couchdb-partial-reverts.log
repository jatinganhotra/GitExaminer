Commit message - Remove leftovers from broken becnhmark

While I tried to land COUCHDB-1432 on 1..x.x it turned out that
/benches/run is broken in several places for a longer time and
nobody noticed: When trying to fix it (adding a file called
test_setup.js) to the template, we will get the next error.

As nobody noticed that it is broken for a longer time it seems we
currently have no need for benchmarks, and if we have that need,
we should add new ones which reflect our current needs and are
compatible with 2.0 too.

This removes the leftovers of the benchmark which is also broken
on 1.6.x for a longer, unknown time which was already deleted in
parts for 2.0

Commit message - Avoid a possible race condition.

The old code was relying on a DOWN message being sent before a call
to get the current ref counter. Its possible that the request was
sent before that happened causing an error.

The new code doesn't use messages from the child process and instead
uses a monitor to know when the process went down. Then it sends
up to 10,000 requests for the current count. Theoretically the only
way this will fail is if the DOWN message to the ref_counter is
delayed for an extremely long time or dropped entirely.

Commit message - faster implementation of pread_iolist. Closes COUCHDB-762

Why it's faster:
- 2 pread() calls (instead of 3) for MD5-prefixed terms
- 1 gen_server:call (instead of 3) in all cases, also guarantees that
we don't intersperse pread() calls to different parts of the file when we
have concurrent readers.

Commit message - Remove leftovers from broken becnhmark

While I tried to land COUCHDB-1432 on 1..x.x it turned out that
/benches/run is broken in several places for a longer time and
nobody noticed: When trying to fix it (adding a file called
test_setup.js) to the template, we will get the next error.

As nobody noticed that it is broken for a longer time it seems we
currently have no need for benchmarks, and if we have that need,
we should add new ones which reflect our current needs and are
compatible with 2.0 too.

This removes the leftovers of the benchmark which is also broken
on 1.6.x for a longer, unknown time which was already deleted in
parts for 2.0

Commit message - Remove leftovers from broken becnhmark

While I tried to land COUCHDB-1432 on 1..x.x it turned out that
/benches/run is broken in several places for a longer time and
nobody noticed: When trying to fix it (adding a file called
test_setup.js) to the template, we will get the next error.

As nobody noticed that it is broken for a longer time it seems we
currently have no need for benchmarks, and if we have that need,
we should add new ones which reflect our current needs and are
compatible with 2.0 too.

This removes the leftovers of the benchmark which is also broken
on 1.6.x for a longer, unknown time which was already deleted in
parts for 2.0

Commit message - Remove leftovers from broken becnhmark

While I tried to land COUCHDB-1432 on 1..x.x it turned out that
/benches/run is broken in several places for a longer time and
nobody noticed: When trying to fix it (adding a file called
test_setup.js) to the template, we will get the next error.

As nobody noticed that it is broken for a longer time it seems we
currently have no need for benchmarks, and if we have that need,
we should add new ones which reflect our current needs and are
compatible with 2.0 too.

This removes the leftovers of the benchmark which is also broken
on 1.6.x for a longer, unknown time which was already deleted in
parts for 2.0

Commit message - Remove leftovers from broken becnhmark

While I tried to land COUCHDB-1432 on 1..x.x it turned out that
/benches/run is broken in several places for a longer time and
nobody noticed: When trying to fix it (adding a file called
test_setup.js) to the template, we will get the next error.

As nobody noticed that it is broken for a longer time it seems we
currently have no need for benchmarks, and if we have that need,
we should add new ones which reflect our current needs and are
compatible with 2.0 too.

This removes the leftovers of the benchmark which is also broken
on 1.6.x for a longer, unknown time which was already deleted in
parts for 2.0

Commit message - Remove leftovers from broken becnhmark

While I tried to land COUCHDB-1432 on 1..x.x it turned out that
/benches/run is broken in several places for a longer time and
nobody noticed: When trying to fix it (adding a file called
test_setup.js) to the template, we will get the next error.

As nobody noticed that it is broken for a longer time it seems we
currently have no need for benchmarks, and if we have that need,
we should add new ones which reflect our current needs and are
compatible with 2.0 too.

This removes the leftovers of the benchmark which is also broken
on 1.6.x for a longer, unknown time which was already deleted in
parts for 2.0

Commit message - Remove leftovers from broken becnhmark

While I tried to land COUCHDB-1432 on 1..x.x it turned out that
/benches/run is broken in several places for a longer time and
nobody noticed: When trying to fix it (adding a file called
test_setup.js) to the template, we will get the next error.

As nobody noticed that it is broken for a longer time it seems we
currently have no need for benchmarks, and if we have that need,
we should add new ones which reflect our current needs and are
compatible with 2.0 too.

This removes the leftovers of the benchmark which is also broken
on 1.6.x for a longer, unknown time which was already deleted in
parts for 2.0

Commit message - Remove leftovers from broken becnhmark

While I tried to land COUCHDB-1432 on 1..x.x it turned out that
/benches/run is broken in several places for a longer time and
nobody noticed: When trying to fix it (adding a file called
test_setup.js) to the template, we will get the next error.

As nobody noticed that it is broken for a longer time it seems we
currently have no need for benchmarks, and if we have that need,
we should add new ones which reflect our current needs and are
compatible with 2.0 too.

This removes the leftovers of the benchmark which is also broken
on 1.6.x for a longer, unknown time which was already deleted in
parts for 2.0

Commit message - Make the doc multipart GET APIs always send attachments compressed

For attachments that are stored in compressed (gzip) form, make sure the
document multipart/related and multipart/mixed APIs don't decompress the
attachments before sending them through the socket. This is to avoid multipart
parser issues when the attachment's identity length is unknown or lost due to
a local to local replication triggered by CouchDB versions up to 1.0.1

Closes COUCHDB-1022.

Commit message - Removed unnecessary iolist_to_binary/1 calls

These IOlist to binary conversions are not necessary since ibrowse accepts
IOlists as outputs of streaming functions. Also, having the IOlists getting
converted into binaries by the erts (instead of user Erlang code) is more
efficient.

Commit message - Adapt replication manager to the new replicator's code

Now all the replication document management is done only by the
couch_replication_manager module, instead of being split by this
module and replication gen_servers. The code is also simpler now,
since it uses the couch_replication_notifier gen_event.

This is a pure refactoring, not adding any new behaviour.

Commit message - Remove leftovers from broken becnhmark

While I tried to land COUCHDB-1432 on 1..x.x it turned out that
/benches/run is broken in several places for a longer time and
nobody noticed: When trying to fix it (adding a file called
test_setup.js) to the template, we will get the next error.

As nobody noticed that it is broken for a longer time it seems we
currently have no need for benchmarks, and if we have that need,
we should add new ones which reflect our current needs and are
compatible with 2.0 too.

This removes the leftovers of the benchmark which is also broken
on 1.6.x for a longer, unknown time which was already deleted in
parts for 2.0

Commit message - Replication manager: fix occasional race conditions

Fix rare race conditions when making the transition of replication states.
These are likely to happen for very short lived replications like the ones in the
test suite, or when deleting or changing the replicator database during runtime.

These race conditions were added in the refactoring done in revision 1079483 (which
adapted the replication manager to the new replicator code).

Commit message - ejson application init function must return 'true' on R13B03

On OTP R13B03, the function invoked by the "on_load" directive (introduced
in this release) must return the atom 'true' and not 'ok'.
The Erlang preprocessor also seems to ignore any unknown directives, so
the use of the "on_load" directive should not cause compilation errors
on older OTP releases (<= R13B02).

Thanks to Matt Goodall for reporting this and providing a patch.

Commit message - Track used space for database and view index files

The database and view group info URIs now expose a new field, named "data_size",
which corresponds to the number of bytes used by the current data snapshot.
Users can now use this value, compare it to the "disk_size" value (total file size)
and decide whether or not to trigger a compaction based on this comparison.
This new value is an approximation and therefore not 100% accurate (but close enough).

Closes COUCHDB-1132.

Special thanks to Adam Kocoloski and Robert Dionne for they're good work on this
feature as well.

Commit message - Bug fix in couch_work_queue: state's size not decremented

When dequeing some items from the queue (that is, not taking all the queued items)
the size field of the gen_server's state was not being decremented as it should.
However when all the queue items are delivered to a consumer, the size is set to 0.

This particular fix has a good impact in the new replicator because it uses work queues
and the consumers only dequeue 1 item at a time - producers will no longer be blocked
until the queue gets empty.
For a push replication that used to take about 15 minutes, it now takes about 13 minutes.

Commit message - Remove leftovers from broken becnhmark

While I tried to land COUCHDB-1432 on 1..x.x it turned out that
/benches/run is broken in several places for a longer time and
nobody noticed: When trying to fix it (adding a file called
test_setup.js) to the template, we will get the next error.

As nobody noticed that it is broken for a longer time it seems we
currently have no need for benchmarks, and if we have that need,
we should add new ones which reflect our current needs and are
compatible with 2.0 too.

This removes the leftovers of the benchmark which is also broken
on 1.6.x for a longer, unknown time which was already deleted in
parts for 2.0

for inner nodes and can return a tuple {skip, Acc} in order to skip
exploration of the branch.

Commit message - Remove leftovers from broken becnhmark

While I tried to land COUCHDB-1432 on 1..x.x it turned out that
/benches/run is broken in several places for a longer time and
nobody noticed: When trying to fix it (adding a file called
test_setup.js) to the template, we will get the next error.

As nobody noticed that it is broken for a longer time it seems we
currently have no need for benchmarks, and if we have that need,
we should add new ones which reflect our current needs and are
compatible with 2.0 too.

This removes the leftovers of the benchmark which is also broken
on 1.6.x for a longer, unknown time which was already deleted in
parts for 2.0

variants of Spidermonkey.

Versions tested:

    1.7.0
    1.8.0rc1

    1.9.2.something (XULRunner)

Various combinations have been tested on OS X, Ubuntu, FreeBSD and

Commit message - Add test test/etap/042-work-queue.t

So far the couch_work_queue module had no unit tests at
all. This module is important for the view updater and
the replicator.

Commit message - Remove leftovers from broken becnhmark

While I tried to land COUCHDB-1432 on 1..x.x it turned out that
/benches/run is broken in several places for a longer time and
nobody noticed: When trying to fix it (adding a file called
test_setup.js) to the template, we will get the next error.

As nobody noticed that it is broken for a longer time it seems we
currently have no need for benchmarks, and if we have that need,
we should add new ones which reflect our current needs and are
compatible with 2.0 too.

This removes the leftovers of the benchmark which is also broken
on 1.6.x for a longer, unknown time which was already deleted in
parts for 2.0

Commit message - Efficient implementation of builtin filters

Currently, the builtin changes filters "_doc_ids" and "_design"
are not very efficient because they fold the entire seq btree
and then filter the values by document ID.
This implementation avoids that by doing direct lookups against
the id btree, and then, for continuous changes requests, it
just listens for database update events and does partial seq
btree folds.

Commit message - Fix builtin changes filters with ?descending=true

After a recent optimization (COUCHDB-1288), querying the _changes
feed using one of the builtin filters (_doc_ids, _design) with
?descending=true was not producing the correct results anymore.
This changes fixes it and adds a test.

Commit message - Remove leftovers from broken becnhmark

While I tried to land COUCHDB-1432 on 1..x.x it turned out that
/benches/run is broken in several places for a longer time and
nobody noticed: When trying to fix it (adding a file called
test_setup.js) to the template, we will get the next error.

As nobody noticed that it is broken for a longer time it seems we
currently have no need for benchmarks, and if we have that need,
we should add new ones which reflect our current needs and are
compatible with 2.0 too.

This removes the leftovers of the benchmark which is also broken
on 1.6.x for a longer, unknown time which was already deleted in

We can't do this without other changes since couch_db:get_design_docs
is hard coded to skip deleted documents, and that's incompatible with
how _changes is supposed to behave.

Commit message - More efficient communication with the view server

This change makes the communication between the Erlang VM and
an external view server (couchjs for e.g.) more efficient by
writing a series of commands into the port and reading all the
responses from the external view server after doing all those
writes. This minimizes the amount of time each endpoint spends
blocked reading from the port.

This reverts commit 9f2398faef3936a844caffbaf3eef8675383ccfd which
switched couch_log to use disk_log. Unfortunately that module performs
positioned writes which prevents the usual logrotation strategy from
working correctly.

Commit message - Fix SpiderMonkey version detection

Randall's last patch to only test for JSOPTION_ANONFUNFIX ended up
reordering the test before the headers were located. This ran into
errors in version detection. This patch reorders the header location as
well as adds a few more default search paths when no --with-js-include
option is specified to account for newer SpiderMonkeys that puth their
headers into $PREFIX/include/js.

Commit message - Ensure compaction respects compression setting

For a database with file format version 6 (CouchDB 1.2+), if
the file_compression setting was changed, compaction ignored
it, making it impossible to change the compression method of
a database and its indexes.

Commit message - COUCHDB-111 handle multiple files in couchjs

Rather than concatenating all the input files and compiling them into a
script with the name '<multiple files>', compile each one and execute
it with the same globals.

This change is intended to aide in COUCHDB-111 by preserving file name
and line number information when executing scripts.

Commit message - Fix random failures in replication.js test

This should fix the random failures for the 'expected "25" got "31"
error message that pops up occasionally. If my hunch is correct when we
remove the two docs from the source db its possible to get the writes on
the target out of order depending on a race condition.

This just sleeps a bit in between the deletions to try and reduce that
possibility. I haven't spotted this error after applying this patch.

Commit message - Remove leftovers from broken becnhmark

While I tried to land COUCHDB-1432 on 1..x.x it turned out that
/benches/run is broken in several places for a longer time and
nobody noticed: When trying to fix it (adding a file called
test_setup.js) to the template, we will get the next error.

As nobody noticed that it is broken for a longer time it seems we
currently have no need for benchmarks, and if we have that need,
we should add new ones which reflect our current needs and are
compatible with 2.0 too.

This removes the leftovers of the benchmark which is also broken
on 1.6.x for a longer, unknown time which was already deleted in
parts for 2.0

Commit message - Avoid possible timeout initializing replications

If 2 different replications start and finish at about the same
time, there's a chance one is doing a synchronous gen_server
call to the replication manager (to notify it that it started)
while the replication manager is doing a call to the replication
supervisor because the other replication just finished.

Commit message - Handle ddoc_updated event correctly.

COUCHDB-1309 introduced a new update event of the form {ddoc_updated,
{DbName, DDocId}}. Unfortunately it did not update
couch_db_update_notifier with a clause that can marshal this to JSON
successfully, breaking all uses of [update_notification]

This commit improves event encoding so that the above renders as
{"type":"ddoc_updated","db":"DbName","id":"DDocId"}

Commit message - Remove leftovers from broken becnhmark

While I tried to land COUCHDB-1432 on 1..x.x it turned out that
/benches/run is broken in several places for a longer time and
nobody noticed: When trying to fix it (adding a file called
test_setup.js) to the template, we will get the next error.

As nobody noticed that it is broken for a longer time it seems we
currently have no need for benchmarks, and if we have that need,
we should add new ones which reflect our current needs and are

Commit message - COUCHDB-1512 - Validate bind address

This patch validate the bind_address value before attempting to bind
the mochiweb socket, giving an 'invalid_bind_address' error. This
should help users who have specified a hostname or made a typo as the
original error was less helpful.

Fix as suggested by Dave Cottlehuber.

This can be used to serve up files like /crossdomain.xml from a
CouchDB instance. For example, you could add:

    [httpd_global_handlers]
    crossdomain.xml = {couch_httpd_misc_handlers, handle_file_req, "/usr/share/couchdb/www/crossdomain.xml" }

To your local.ini to serve up crossdomain.xml.

Commit message - Remove leftovers from broken becnhmark

While I tried to land COUCHDB-1432 on 1..x.x it turned out that
/benches/run is broken in several places for a longer time and
nobody noticed: When trying to fix it (adding a file called
test_setup.js) to the template, we will get the next error.

As nobody noticed that it is broken for a longer time it seems we
currently have no need for benchmarks, and if we have that need,
we should add new ones which reflect our current needs and are
compatible with 2.0 too.

This removes the leftovers of the benchmark which is also broken
on 1.6.x for a longer, unknown time which was already deleted in

Commit message - WIP: flesh out doc CRUD, add notifications, fix glyphs

Start working on making the transitions between all docs and docs
functional. Added in logic for save docs to check for valid code and
either add a fail warning or saving notification.

Added in notion of a pageUrl, which is a way for a model to define
where it is located in terms of a REST resource. There is a fair bit
of overlap with the url function, but not always, and its relative vs
absolute. I'm not a huge fan of the way pageUrl is setup and
constructed right now, but we do need a way for a modal to define
where its accessible in the app. Ie given a database or a doc, you can
provide a route compatible url that will get you to the relevant page
for that item.

We should also consider restructuring the application urls to be more
restful and not necessarily map directly to the couchdb urls, as we
have the api bar down on the bottom which does a much better job.
Things like listing all databases should potentially just be
/databases in the url as /databases/_all_dbs is akward, and becomes
tricky to distinguish between /databases/_design%2Fasdf.

Another related option is setting up a route
/databases/_design/:ddoc_id that will allow us to explicitly handle
design docs and we can use a different default view. For instance, on
normal docs, I prefer to see the code editor JSON, but on ddocs I
would like to see a higher level representation.

I temporarily added in div.view.show to make the styling and buttons
work on the _all_docs list, but we should replace that and move away
from that model.

Also fixed image copying in the build so the glyph icons work now, and
any other images will now be there as well.

Added a notification API allowing you to set a msg, notification type,
and optionally specify a target or by default just use a global notifier.

Commit message - Document CRUD functionality

Lots of document CRUD updates. Most operations are in place and
functional now.

Two large issues this work uncovered.

1) Shared state between "urls." URLs imply a different stateful
resource, but when resources can be shared between multiple pages,
then the notion of mapping actions to URLs is less useful, and becomes
more complicated. For instance, the doc editor provides both a code
editor and a field editor, binding the data between the two gets
tricky as the two editors are different pages and different URLs. In
this case, we want to be able to share state between different child
pages, or more generally, we want the ability to share state between
subtabs and subpages.

2) When you have pages and subpages with nearly identical structure,
we still have a huge amount of duplicated boilerplate. For instance
the code and field editors use the same overall structure, but one
view is swapped out. We should have a way to remove the duplicated
boiler plate allowing each of those pages to be easily gernerated.
Alternatively, we could have subpages define what views they want to
swap out, and just extend from a parent page.

This commit has a handful of other random changes, like switching
pageUrl to just url with an optional context for switching on.

Commit message - Unfix view compaction progress reports

This reverts the compaction task status progress back to what exists on
1.2.x. The issue is that we use the number of documents in the database
instead of the number of docids in the union of all views (the number of
rows in the view's id btree). In this particular case the desire to have
seamless view upgrades outweighs fixing the relatively minor UI bug.

Commit message - Remove leftovers from broken becnhmark

While I tried to land COUCHDB-1432 on 1..x.x it turned out that
/benches/run is broken in several places for a longer time and
nobody noticed: When trying to fix it (adding a file called
test_setup.js) to the template, we will get the next error.

As nobody noticed that it is broken for a longer time it seems we
currently have no need for benchmarks, and if we have that need,
we should add new ones which reflect our current needs and are
compatible with 2.0 too.

This removes the leftovers of the benchmark which is also broken
on 1.6.x for a longer, unknown time which was already deleted in
parts for 2.0

Commit message - Add Experimental Content-Security-Policy-Support (CSP) for Fauxton

Like every web application, Fauxton is vulnerable against XSS and
CSP is a technology that tries to help against that.

The patch makes it possible to enable CSP for the /_utils path and
allows configuration of the sent header.

The default setting for the value of the header breaks the old
Futon, when CSP is enabled there. The old Futon has alot of
inline-JavaScript which is not allowed in the setting I have
chosen as default.

For development, the header is also sent from the Node server
which launches Fauxton in dev-mode.

People can enable the feature by setting enable = true in the
section [csp] of their configs

variants of Spidermonkey.

Versions tested:

    1.7.0
    1.8.0rc1
    1.8.5
    1.9.2.something (XULRunner)

Various combinations have been tested on OS X, Ubuntu, FreeBSD and

Commit message - Efficient implementation of builtin filters

Currently, the builtin changes filters "_doc_ids" and "_design"
are not very efficient because they fold the entire seq btree
and then filter the values by document ID.
This implementation avoids that by doing direct lookups against
the id btree, and then, for continuous changes requests, it
just listens for database update events and does partial seq
btree folds.

After a recent optimization (COUCHDB-1288), querying the _changes
feed using one of the builtin filters (_doc_ids, _design) with

This changes fixes it and adds a test.

We can't do this without other changes since couch_db:get_design_docs
is hard coded to skip deleted documents, and that's incompatible with
how _changes is supposed to behave.

Commit message - More efficient communication with the view server

This change makes the communication between the Erlang VM and
an external view server (couchjs for e.g.) more efficient by
writing a series of commands into the port and reading all the
responses from the external view server after doing all those
writes. This minimizes the amount of time each endpoint spends
blocked reading from the port.

This reverts commit 9f2398faef3936a844caffbaf3eef8675383ccfd which
switched couch_log to use disk_log. Unfortunately that module performs
positioned writes which prevents the usual logrotation strategy from
working correctly.

Commit message - Fix SpiderMonkey version detection

Randall's last patch to only test for JSOPTION_ANONFUNFIX ended up
reordering the test before the headers were located. This ran into
errors in version detection. This patch reorders the header location as
well as adds a few more default search paths when no --with-js-include
option is specified to account for newer SpiderMonkeys that puth their
headers into $PREFIX/include/js.

For a database with file format version 6 (CouchDB 1.2+), if
the file_compression setting was changed, compaction ignored
it, making it impossible to change the compression method of
a database and its indexes.

jquery.couch.js is a javascript library and should not assume it's
running inside a browser. Particularly, it should not call
alert(). Instead it should throw an exception.

Commit message - Remove assertion when database compaction finishes

Because the task status is updated only if the time elapsed
since the last task status update is greater than some treshold,
the value of the changes_done property might be smaller than
TotalChanges.

Commit message - Fix random failures in replication.js test

This should fix the random failures for the 'expected "25" got "31"
error message that pops up occasionally. If my hunch is correct when we
remove the two docs from the source db its possible to get the writes on
the target out of order depending on a race condition.

This just sleeps a bit in between the deletions to try and reduce that
possibility. I haven't spotted this error after applying this patch.

Commit message - Avoid possible timeout initializing replications

If 2 different replications start and finish at about the same
time, there's a chance one is doing a synchronous gen_server
call to the replication manager (to notify it that it started)
while the replication manager is doing a call to the replication
supervisor because the other replication just finished.

Commit message - Handle ddoc_updated event correctly.

COUCHDB-1309 introduced a new update event of the form {ddoc_updated,
{DbName, DDocId}}. Unfortunately it did not update
couch_db_update_notifier with a clause that can marshal this to JSON
successfully, breaking all uses of [update_notification]

This commit improves event encoding so that the above renders as
{"type":"ddoc_updated","db":"DbName","id":"DDocId"}

Commit message - COUCHDB-1512 - Validate bind address

This patch validate the bind_address value before attempting to bind
the mochiweb socket, giving an 'invalid_bind_address' error. This
should help users who have specified a hostname or made a typo as the
original error was less helpful.

Fix as suggested by Dave Cottlehuber.

Commit message - Add couch_httpd_misc_handlers:handle_file_req

This can be used to serve up files like /crossdomain.xml from a
CouchDB instance. For example, you could add:

    [httpd_global_handlers]
    crossdomain.xml = {couch_httpd_misc_handlers, handle_file_req, "/usr/share/couchdb/www/crossdomain.xml" }

To your local.ini to serve up crossdomain.xml.

Commit message - WIP: flesh out doc CRUD, add notifications, fix glyphs

Start working on making the transitions between all docs and docs
functional. Added in logic for save docs to check for valid code and
either add a fail warning or saving notification.

Added in notion of a pageUrl, which is a way for a model to define
where it is located in terms of a REST resource. There is a fair bit
of overlap with the url function, but not always, and its relative vs
absolute. I'm not a huge fan of the way pageUrl is setup and
constructed right now, but we do need a way for a modal to define
where its accessible in the app. Ie given a database or a doc, you can
provide a route compatible url that will get you to the relevant page
for that item.

We should also consider restructuring the application urls to be more
restful and not necessarily map directly to the couchdb urls, as we
have the api bar down on the bottom which does a much better job.
Things like listing all databases should potentially just be
/databases in the url as /databases/_all_dbs is akward, and becomes
tricky to distinguish between /databases/_design%2Fasdf.

Another related option is setting up a route
/databases/_design/:ddoc_id that will allow us to explicitly handle
design docs and we can use a different default view. For instance, on
normal docs, I prefer to see the code editor JSON, but on ddocs I
would like to see a higher level representation.

I temporarily added in div.view.show to make the styling and buttons
work on the _all_docs list, but we should replace that and move away
from that model.

Also fixed image copying in the build so the glyph icons work now, and
any other images will now be there as well.

Added a notification API allowing you to set a msg, notification type,
and optionally specify a target or by default just use a global notifier.

Commit message - Document CRUD functionality

Lots of document CRUD updates. Most operations are in place and
functional now.

Two large issues this work uncovered.

1) Shared state between "urls." URLs imply a different stateful
resource, but when resources can be shared between multiple pages,
then the notion of mapping actions to URLs is less useful, and becomes
more complicated. For instance, the doc editor provides both a code
editor and a field editor, binding the data between the two gets
tricky as the two editors are different pages and different URLs. In
this case, we want to be able to share state between different child
pages, or more generally, we want the ability to share state between
subtabs and subpages.

2) When you have pages and subpages with nearly identical structure,
we still have a huge amount of duplicated boilerplate. For instance
the code and field editors use the same overall structure, but one
view is swapped out. We should have a way to remove the duplicated
boiler plate allowing each of those pages to be easily gernerated.
Alternatively, we could have subpages define what views they want to
swap out, and just extend from a parent page.

This commit has a handful of other random changes, like switching
pageUrl to just url with an optional context for switching on.

Windows uses a different gzip implementation, and therefore generates
different MD5-Digests than other platforms. Using binary Content-Type
resolves this.

Commit message - Unfix view compaction progress reports

This reverts the compaction task status progress back to what exists on
1.2.x. The issue is that we use the number of documents in the database
instead of the number of docids in the union of all views (the number of
rows in the view's id btree). In this particular case the desire to have
seamless view upgrades outweighs fixing the relatively minor UI bug.

Commit message - Fix CORS error with attachments

When attachments were returned (?attachments=true) while CORS was
enabled and used, an error occured. The reason for this error
were headers that were encoded as binaries instead of lists. String
operations on binaries throw errors.

This commit fixes COUCHDB-1689.

Commit message - Fix 231-cors.t test suite (again)

That's interesting issue: couch_passwords:hash_admin_password accepts
password as binary string, but list one had been passed instead. This
causes crush with function_clause reason. Ok, but this crush left
hidden for R15/R16 - only R14 shows stack trace in output and alerts
that's something wrong. To be honest, *sometimes* it's also possible
to reproduce this test suite crush with modern Erlang releases,
but it will be about Bad Plan: planned 27 test, but run only 26.
Nothing specific.

So, silent crush prevented other tests to be run and also counted by
the plan. Now this is fixed.

Commit message - Fauxton: Fix QueryParams

Ensure we clone the parameters to Documents.QueryParams.parse and
Documents.QueryParams.stringify. These functions should return new data
structures rather than modifying the input in-place.

Do not use the parsed query object for url generation. Instead, use the
stringified representation. Fixes COUCHDB-2249.

---> The original commit sha is - 7439833ea51ac1436f341c7aab6e8de1fe4a2a18
Commit message - Verify that auth-related properties are well-formed

Passing unexpected values to auth fields can result in server
issues. Notably, setting "iterations" to a string will cause an
infinite loop as the comparison 'when Iteration > Iterations' will
never evaluate to true.

The latest validate_doc_update prevents user docs with this problem
and administrators can deploy that check themselves (and only
administrators can edit design documents).

A server administrator can also insist on lower and upper bounds for
iteration count to reject weakly protected passwords and
resource-hungry passwords respectively.

Commit message - Remove client-side password crypto from JS tests

This removes client-side password crypto from the JavaScript tests.

In some JavaScript tests, it has been assumed that SHA-1 is used for the
password hash in user docs.  Those tests should, however, not rely on
implementation details of the user authentication hash function, as it
isn't the goal of those tests to check these.  Furthermore, this causes
problems when a password scheme is changed, or a new one is introduced.

Commit message - Fix 231-cors.t test suite (again)

That's interesting issue: couch_passwords:hash_admin_password accepts
password as binary string, but list one had been passed instead. This
causes crush with function_clause reason. Ok, but this crush left
hidden for R15/R16 - only R14 shows stack trace in output and alerts
that's something wrong. To be honest, *sometimes* it's also possible
to reproduce this test suite crush with modern Erlang releases,
but it will be about Bad Plan: planned 27 test, but run only 26.
Nothing specific.

So, silent crush prevented other tests to be run and also counted by
the plan. Now this is fixed.

Commit message - fix right hand side scrolling over navigation

If the right hand content got really wide, then
it could easily be scrolled over the primary
navigation on the left.

Fixed it by fixed positioning it.

Commit message - Revert "fix right hand side scrolling over navigation"

This reverts commit e389a8ba2a79da2669b536ca242b5dfdee4faba3.

This is the commit that broke modals.

Reverting it fixes COUCHDB-2086

Fixing the right hand content overlapping the left
hand navigation will require a bigger fix...
This sadly was not it...

Commit message - Efficient implementation of builtin filters

Currently, the builtin changes filters "_doc_ids" and "_design"
are not very efficient because they fold the entire seq btree
and then filter the values by document ID.
This implementation avoids that by doing direct lookups against
the id btree, and then, for continuous changes requests, it
just listens for database update events and does partial seq
btree folds.

Commit message - Fix builtin changes filters with ?descending=true

After a recent optimization (COUCHDB-1288), querying the _changes
feed using one of the builtin filters (_doc_ids, _design) with
?descending=true was not producing the correct results anymore.
This changes fixes it and adds a test.

We can't do this without other changes since couch_db:get_design_docs
is hard coded to skip deleted documents, and that's incompatible with
how _changes is supposed to behave.

Commit message - More efficient communication with the view server

This change makes the communication between the Erlang VM and
an external view server (couchjs for e.g.) more efficient by
writing a series of commands into the port and reading all the
responses from the external view server after doing all those
writes. This minimizes the amount of time each endpoint spends
blocked reading from the port.

This reverts commit 9f2398faef3936a844caffbaf3eef8675383ccfd which
switched couch_log to use disk_log. Unfortunately that module performs
positioned writes which prevents the usual logrotation strategy from
working correctly.

Commit message - Fix SpiderMonkey version detection

Randall's last patch to only test for JSOPTION_ANONFUNFIX ended up
reordering the test before the headers were located. This ran into
errors in version detection. This patch reorders the header location as
well as adds a few more default search paths when no --with-js-include
option is specified to account for newer SpiderMonkeys that puth their
headers into $PREFIX/include/js.

Commit message - Ensure compaction respects compression setting

For a database with file format version 6 (CouchDB 1.2+), if
the file_compression setting was changed, compaction ignored
it, making it impossible to change the compression method of
a database and its indexes.

Commit message - COUCHDB-111 handle multiple files in couchjs

Rather than concatenating all the input files and compiling them into a
script with the name '<multiple files>', compile each one and execute
it with the same globals.

This change is intended to aide in COUCHDB-111 by preserving file name
and line number information when executing scripts.

Commit message - Fix random failures in replication.js test

This should fix the random failures for the 'expected "25" got "31"
error message that pops up occasionally. If my hunch is correct when we
remove the two docs from the source db its possible to get the writes on
the target out of order depending on a race condition.

This just sleeps a bit in between the deletions to try and reduce that
possibility. I haven't spotted this error after applying this patch.

Commit message - Avoid possible timeout initializing replications

If 2 different replications start and finish at about the same
time, there's a chance one is doing a synchronous gen_server
call to the replication manager (to notify it that it started)
while the replication manager is doing a call to the replication
supervisor because the other replication just finished.

Commit message - Handle ddoc_updated event correctly.

COUCHDB-1309 introduced a new update event of the form {ddoc_updated,
{DbName, DDocId}}. Unfortunately it did not update
couch_db_update_notifier with a clause that can marshal this to JSON
successfully, breaking all uses of [update_notification]

This commit improves event encoding so that the above renders as
{"type":"ddoc_updated","db":"DbName","id":"DDocId"}

Commit message - COUCHDB-1512 - Validate bind address

This patch validate the bind_address value before attempting to bind
the mochiweb socket, giving an 'invalid_bind_address' error. This
should help users who have specified a hostname or made a typo as the
original error was less helpful.

Fix as suggested by Dave Cottlehuber.

Commit message - Changing "Install as Couchapp" instructions

The instructions didn't work for me. I also prefer not installing node modules globally.

I also removed the step of building CouchDB as I'd expect most people that want to run it as a CouchApp already have a couch installed.

Commit message - Add couch_httpd_misc_handlers:handle_file_req

This can be used to serve up files like /crossdomain.xml from a
CouchDB instance. For example, you could add:

    [httpd_global_handlers]
    crossdomain.xml = {couch_httpd_misc_handlers, handle_file_req, "/usr/share/couchdb/www/crossdomain.xml" }

To your local.ini to serve up crossdomain.xml.

Commit message - WIP: flesh out doc CRUD, add notifications, fix glyphs

Start working on making the transitions between all docs and docs
functional. Added in logic for save docs to check for valid code and
either add a fail warning or saving notification.

Added in notion of a pageUrl, which is a way for a model to define
where it is located in terms of a REST resource. There is a fair bit
of overlap with the url function, but not always, and its relative vs
absolute. I'm not a huge fan of the way pageUrl is setup and
constructed right now, but we do need a way for a modal to define
where its accessible in the app. Ie given a database or a doc, you can
provide a route compatible url that will get you to the relevant page
for that item.

We should also consider restructuring the application urls to be more
restful and not necessarily map directly to the couchdb urls, as we
have the api bar down on the bottom which does a much better job.
Things like listing all databases should potentially just be
/databases in the url as /databases/_all_dbs is akward, and becomes
tricky to distinguish between /databases/_design%2Fasdf.

Another related option is setting up a route
/databases/_design/:ddoc_id that will allow us to explicitly handle
design docs and we can use a different default view. For instance, on
normal docs, I prefer to see the code editor JSON, but on ddocs I
would like to see a higher level representation.

I temporarily added in div.view.show to make the styling and buttons
work on the _all_docs list, but we should replace that and move away
from that model.

Also fixed image copying in the build so the glyph icons work now, and
any other images will now be there as well.

Added a notification API allowing you to set a msg, notification type,
and optionally specify a target or by default just use a global notifier.

Commit message - Document CRUD functionality

Lots of document CRUD updates. Most operations are in place and
functional now.

Two large issues this work uncovered.

1) Shared state between "urls." URLs imply a different stateful
resource, but when resources can be shared between multiple pages,
then the notion of mapping actions to URLs is less useful, and becomes
more complicated. For instance, the doc editor provides both a code
editor and a field editor, binding the data between the two gets
tricky as the two editors are different pages and different URLs. In
this case, we want to be able to share state between different child
pages, or more generally, we want the ability to share state between
subtabs and subpages.

2) When you have pages and subpages with nearly identical structure,
we still have a huge amount of duplicated boilerplate. For instance
the code and field editors use the same overall structure, but one
view is swapped out. We should have a way to remove the duplicated
boiler plate allowing each of those pages to be easily gernerated.
Alternatively, we could have subpages define what views they want to
swap out, and just extend from a parent page.

This commit has a handful of other random changes, like switching
pageUrl to just url with an optional context for switching on.

Commit message - Use non-compressed Content-Type in attachments test suites

MD5-Digests of attachments are calculated on the compressed data if the
attachment MIME type is compressible, as defined in default.ini
[attachments] compressible_types

Windows uses a different gzip implementation, and therefore generates
different MD5-Digests than other platforms. Using binary Content-Type
resolves this.

Commit message - Unfix view compaction progress reports

This reverts the compaction task status progress back to what exists on
1.2.x. The issue is that we use the number of documents in the database
instead of the number of docids in the union of all views (the number of
rows in the view's id btree). In this particular case the desire to have
seamless view upgrades outweighs fixing the relatively minor UI bug.

Commit message - Fix CORS error with attachments

When attachments were returned (?attachments=true) while CORS was
enabled and used, an error occured. The reason for this error
were headers that were encoded as binaries instead of lists. String
operations on binaries throw errors.

This commit fixes COUCHDB-1689.

the replicator.

Commit message - Efficient implementation of builtin filters

Currently, the builtin changes filters "_doc_ids" and "_design"
are not very efficient because they fold the entire seq btree
and then filter the values by document ID.
This implementation avoids that by doing direct lookups against
the id btree, and then, for continuous changes requests, it
just listens for database update events and does partial seq
btree folds.

Commit message - Fix builtin changes filters with ?descending=true

After a recent optimization (COUCHDB-1288), querying the _changes
feed using one of the builtin filters (_doc_ids, _design) with
?descending=true was not producing the correct results anymore.
This changes fixes it and adds a test.

Commit message - Revert "use couch_db calls instead of couch_btree"

We can't do this without other changes since couch_db:get_design_docs
is hard coded to skip deleted documents, and that's incompatible with
how _changes is supposed to behave.

This reverts commit e41d226dca11dc8b24d6c011cc3014e6c553db42.

Commit message - More efficient communication with the view server

This change makes the communication between the Erlang VM and
an external view server (couchjs for e.g.) more efficient by
writing a series of commands into the port and reading all the
responses from the external view server after doing all those
writes. This minimizes the amount of time each endpoint spends
blocked reading from the port.

Commit message - COUCHDB-1380 Revert "Better logger performance"

This reverts commit 9f2398faef3936a844caffbaf3eef8675383ccfd which
switched couch_log to use disk_log. Unfortunately that module performs
positioned writes which prevents the usual logrotation strategy from
working correctly.

Commit message - Fix SpiderMonkey version detection

Randall's last patch to only test for JSOPTION_ANONFUNFIX ended up
reordering the test before the headers were located. This ran into
errors in version detection. This patch reorders the header location as
well as adds a few more default search paths when no --with-js-include
option is specified to account for newer SpiderMonkeys that puth their
headers into $PREFIX/include/js.

Commit message - Ensure compaction respects compression setting

For a database with file format version 6 (CouchDB 1.2+), if
the file_compression setting was changed, compaction ignored
it, making it impossible to change the compression method of
a database and its indexes.

Commit message - COUCHDB-111 handle multiple files in couchjs

Rather than concatenating all the input files and compiling them into a
script with the name '<multiple files>', compile each one and execute
it with the same globals.

This change is intended to aide in COUCHDB-111 by preserving file name
and line number information when executing scripts.

Commit message - Fix random failures in replication.js test

This should fix the random failures for the 'expected "25" got "31"
error message that pops up occasionally. If my hunch is correct when we
remove the two docs from the source db its possible to get the writes on
the target out of order depending on a race condition.

This just sleeps a bit in between the deletions to try and reduce that
possibility. I haven't spotted this error after applying this patch.

Commit message - Avoid possible timeout initializing replications

If 2 different replications start and finish at about the same
time, there's a chance one is doing a synchronous gen_server
call to the replication manager (to notify it that it started)
while the replication manager is doing a call to the replication
supervisor because the other replication just finished.

Commit message - Handle ddoc_updated event correctly.

COUCHDB-1309 introduced a new update event of the form {ddoc_updated,
{DbName, DDocId}}. Unfortunately it did not update
couch_db_update_notifier with a clause that can marshal this to JSON
successfully, breaking all uses of [update_notification]

This commit improves event encoding so that the above renders as
{"type":"ddoc_updated","db":"DbName","id":"DDocId"}

should help users who have specified a hostname or made a typo as the
original error was less helpful.

Fix as suggested by Dave Cottlehuber.

Commit message - Changing "Install as Couchapp" instructions

The instructions didn't work for me. I also prefer not installing node modules globally.

I also removed the step of building CouchDB as I'd expect most people that want to run it as a CouchApp already have a couch installed.

Commit message - Add couch_httpd_misc_handlers:handle_file_req

This can be used to serve up files like /crossdomain.xml from a
CouchDB instance. For example, you could add:

    [httpd_global_handlers]
    crossdomain.xml = {couch_httpd_misc_handlers, handle_file_req, "/usr/share/couchdb/www/crossdomain.xml" }

To your local.ini to serve up crossdomain.xml.

Commit message - WIP: flesh out doc CRUD, add notifications, fix glyphs

Start working on making the transitions between all docs and docs
functional. Added in logic for save docs to check for valid code and
either add a fail warning or saving notification.

Added in notion of a pageUrl, which is a way for a model to define
where it is located in terms of a REST resource. There is a fair bit
of overlap with the url function, but not always, and its relative vs
absolute. I'm not a huge fan of the way pageUrl is setup and
constructed right now, but we do need a way for a modal to define
where its accessible in the app. Ie given a database or a doc, you can
provide a route compatible url that will get you to the relevant page
for that item.

We should also consider restructuring the application urls to be more
restful and not necessarily map directly to the couchdb urls, as we
have the api bar down on the bottom which does a much better job.
Things like listing all databases should potentially just be
/databases in the url as /databases/_all_dbs is akward, and becomes
tricky to distinguish between /databases/_design%2Fasdf.

Another related option is setting up a route
/databases/_design/:ddoc_id that will allow us to explicitly handle
design docs and we can use a different default view. For instance, on
normal docs, I prefer to see the code editor JSON, but on ddocs I
would like to see a higher level representation.

I temporarily added in div.view.show to make the styling and buttons
work on the _all_docs list, but we should replace that and move away
from that model.

Also fixed image copying in the build so the glyph icons work now, and
any other images will now be there as well.

Added a notification API allowing you to set a msg, notification type,
and optionally specify a target or by default just use a global notifier.

Commit message - Document CRUD functionality

Lots of document CRUD updates. Most operations are in place and
functional now.

Two large issues this work uncovered.

1) Shared state between "urls." URLs imply a different stateful
resource, but when resources can be shared between multiple pages,
then the notion of mapping actions to URLs is less useful, and becomes
more complicated. For instance, the doc editor provides both a code
editor and a field editor, binding the data between the two gets
tricky as the two editors are different pages and different URLs. In
this case, we want to be able to share state between different child
pages, or more generally, we want the ability to share state between
subtabs and subpages.

2) When you have pages and subpages with nearly identical structure,
we still have a huge amount of duplicated boilerplate. For instance
the code and field editors use the same overall structure, but one
view is swapped out. We should have a way to remove the duplicated
boiler plate allowing each of those pages to be easily gernerated.
Alternatively, we could have subpages define what views they want to
swap out, and just extend from a parent page.

This commit has a handful of other random changes, like switching
pageUrl to just url with an optional context for switching on.

Commit message - Use non-compressed Content-Type in attachments test suites

MD5-Digests of attachments are calculated on the compressed data if the
attachment MIME type is compressible, as defined in default.ini
[attachments] compressible_types

Windows uses a different gzip implementation, and therefore generates
different MD5-Digests than other platforms. Using binary Content-Type
resolves this.

Commit message - Unfix view compaction progress reports

This reverts the compaction task status progress back to what exists on
1.2.x. The issue is that we use the number of documents in the database
instead of the number of docids in the union of all views (the number of
rows in the view's id btree). In this particular case the desire to have
seamless view upgrades outweighs fixing the relatively minor UI bug.

Commit message - Fix CORS error with attachments

When attachments were returned (?attachments=true) while CORS was
enabled and used, an error occured. The reason for this error
were headers that were encoded as binaries instead of lists. String
operations on binaries throw errors.

This commit fixes COUCHDB-1689.

Commit message - Avoid a possible race condition.

The old code was relying on a DOWN message being sent before a call
to get the current ref counter. Its possible that the request was
sent before that happened causing an error.

The new code doesn't use messages from the child process and instead
uses a monitor to know when the process went down. Then it sends
up to 10,000 requests for the current count. Theoretically the only
way this will fail is if the DOWN message to the ref_counter is
delayed for an extremely long time or dropped entirely.

Commit message - faster implementation of pread_iolist. Closes COUCHDB-762

Why it's faster:
- 2 pread() calls (instead of 3) for MD5-prefixed terms
- 1 gen_server:call (instead of 3) in all cases, also guarantees that
we don't intersperse pread() calls to different parts of the file when we
have concurrent readers.

Commit message - Skip recursive path merging, COUCHDB-968

This patch ensures that we only ever merge a linear path into the tree.
It relies on the stemming code to collapse paths that could have been
merged together by a recursive use of merge_one.

Commit message - Make the doc multipart GET APIs always send attachments compressed

For attachments that are stored in compressed (gzip) form, make sure the
document multipart/related and multipart/mixed APIs don't decompress the
attachments before sending them through the socket. This is to avoid multipart
parser issues when the attachment's identity length is unknown or lost due to
a local to local replication triggered by CouchDB versions up to 1.0.1

Closes COUCHDB-1022.

Commit message - Removed unnecessary iolist_to_binary/1 calls

These IOlist to binary conversions are not necessary since ibrowse accepts
IOlists as outputs of streaming functions. Also, having the IOlists getting
converted into binaries by the erts (instead of user Erlang code) is more
efficient.

Commit message - CouchDB no longer requires cURL to build.

cURL is only used by the command line JavaScript test suite
which is not run by a large number of users. This change
no longer requires cURL to be available for all CouchDB
installations.

Thanks to Randall Leeds for the patch.
Closes COUCHDB-1042

Commit message - Catch all in couch_util:to_binary/1 list argument clause

When a list_to_binary call fails, the error tag is 'error' and not 'throw'.
This was noticed when this clause was being hit in an error clause of the
replication http handler (couch_httpd_replicator.erl).

Commit message - Adapt replication manager to the new replicator's code

Now all the replication document management is done only by the
couch_replication_manager module, instead of being split by this
module and replication gen_servers. The code is also simpler now,
since it uses the couch_replication_notifier gen_event.

This is a pure refactoring, not adding any new behaviour.

Commit message - Replication manager: fix occasional race conditions

Fix rare race conditions when making the transition of replication states.
These are likely to happen for very short lived replications like the ones in the
test suite, or when deleting or changing the replicator database during runtime.

These race conditions were added in the refactoring done in revision 1079483 (which
adapted the replication manager to the new replicator code).

Commit message - Added ejson application

This is a NIF based JSON decoder/encoder based on Paul Davis' eep0018
implementation (https://github.com/davisp/eep0018/), with some modifications
from Damien (big number support and optimizations) on top, plus a few fixes
from my side and Benoît on top of Damien's fork.
This module fallbacks to mochijson2 when the NIF is not loaded or compiled.
The NIF is only compiled and used if we're using an OTP release >= R13B04.

Thanks everyone. Closes COUCHDB-1118.

Commit message - ejson application init function must return 'true' on R13B03

On OTP R13B03, the function invoked by the "on_load" directive (introduced
in this release) must return the atom 'true' and not 'ok'.
The Erlang preprocessor also seems to ignore any unknown directives, so
the use of the "on_load" directive should not cause compilation errors
on older OTP releases (<= R13B02).

Thanks to Matt Goodall for reporting this and providing a patch.

which corresponds to the number of bytes used by the current data snapshot.
Users can now use this value, compare it to the "disk_size" value (total file size)
and decide whether or not to trigger a compaction based on this comparison.
This new value is an approximation and therefore not 100% accurate (but close enough).

Closes COUCHDB-1132.

Special thanks to Adam Kocoloski and Robert Dionne for they're good work on this
feature as well.

Commit message - Configurable database and view compaction parameters

These parameters are now configurable as byte quantities.
Larger buffer sizes can significantly decrease final file sizes and
in some cases make the compaction process faster or slower.

Commit message - Bug fix in couch_work_queue: state's size not decremented

When dequeing some items from the queue (that is, not taking all the queued items)
the size field of the gen_server's state was not being decremented as it should.
However when all the queue items are delivered to a consumer, the size is set to 0.

This particular fix has a good impact in the new replicator because it uses work queues
and the consumers only dequeue 1 item at a time - producers will no longer be blocked
until the queue gets empty.
For a push replication that used to take about 15 minutes, it now takes about 13 minutes.

Previously the fold function was only invoked for leafs.
With this change it's possible to define a fold function which is called
for inner nodes and can return a tuple {skip, Acc} in order to skip
exploration of the branch.

Commit message - Doc validation functions from deleted ddocs must be ignored

If a design document is deleted by updating it with a "_deleted"
field set to the boolean value true, its validate_doc_update function
should be ignored for subsequent document insertions/updates.

This closes COUCHDB-1227.

Commit message - Add configurable automatic compaction

A set of rules can now be defined in order to automatically
trigger the compaction of databases and their views. This
configuration can be global or overrided for specific
databases. By default it's disabled. Enabling it can be
done via the .ini configuration by simply adding global
or database specific compaction rules.

Closes COUCHDB-1153.
Thanks everyone involved who gave feedback and suggestions
for improvements.

So far the couch_work_queue module had no unit tests at
all. This module is important for the view updater and
the replicator.

Commit message - Efficient implementation of builtin filters

Currently, the builtin changes filters "_doc_ids" and "_design"
are not very efficient because they fold the entire seq btree
and then filter the values by document ID.
This implementation avoids that by doing direct lookups against
the id btree, and then, for continuous changes requests, it
just listens for database update events and does partial seq
btree folds.

Commit message - Revert "use couch_db calls instead of couch_btree"

We can't do this without other changes since couch_db:get_design_docs
is hard coded to skip deleted documents, and that's incompatible with
how _changes is supposed to behave.

This reverts commit e41d226dca11dc8b24d6c011cc3014e6c553db42.

Commit message - More efficient communication with the view server

This change makes the communication between the Erlang VM and
an external view server (couchjs for e.g.) more efficient by
writing a series of commands into the port and reading all the
responses from the external view server after doing all those
writes. This minimizes the amount of time each endpoint spends
blocked reading from the port.

Commit message - COUCHDB-1380 Revert "Better logger performance"

This reverts commit 9f2398faef3936a844caffbaf3eef8675383ccfd which
switched couch_log to use disk_log. Unfortunately that module performs
positioned writes which prevents the usual logrotation strategy from
working correctly.

Commit message - Fix SpiderMonkey version detection

Randall's last patch to only test for JSOPTION_ANONFUNFIX ended up
reordering the test before the headers were located. This ran into
errors in version detection. This patch reorders the header location as
well as adds a few more default search paths when no --with-js-include
option is specified to account for newer SpiderMonkeys that puth their
headers into $PREFIX/include/js.

Commit message - Ensure compaction respects compression setting

For a database with file format version 6 (CouchDB 1.2+), if
the file_compression setting was changed, compaction ignored
it, making it impossible to change the compression method of
a database and its indexes.

Commit message - COUCHDB-111 handle multiple files in couchjs

Rather than concatenating all the input files and compiling them into a
script with the name '<multiple files>', compile each one and execute
it with the same globals.

This change is intended to aide in COUCHDB-111 by preserving file name
and line number information when executing scripts.

jquery.couch.js is a javascript library and should not assume it's

alert(). Instead it should throw an exception.

Commit message - Remove assertion when database compaction finishes

Because the task status is updated only if the time elapsed
since the last task status update is greater than some treshold,
the value of the changes_done property might be smaller than
TotalChanges.

Commit message - Fix random failures in replication.js test

This should fix the random failures for the 'expected "25" got "31"
error message that pops up occasionally. If my hunch is correct when we
remove the two docs from the source db its possible to get the writes on
the target out of order depending on a race condition.

This just sleeps a bit in between the deletions to try and reduce that
possibility. I haven't spotted this error after applying this patch.

Commit message - Avoid possible timeout initializing replications

If 2 different replications start and finish at about the same
time, there's a chance one is doing a synchronous gen_server
call to the replication manager (to notify it that it started)
while the replication manager is doing a call to the replication

Commit message - Handle ddoc_updated event correctly.

COUCHDB-1309 introduced a new update event of the form {ddoc_updated,
{DbName, DDocId}}. Unfortunately it did not update
couch_db_update_notifier with a clause that can marshal this to JSON
successfully, breaking all uses of [update_notification]

This commit improves event encoding so that the above renders as
{"type":"ddoc_updated","db":"DbName","id":"DDocId"}

Commit message - COUCHDB-1512 - Validate bind address

This patch validate the bind_address value before attempting to bind
the mochiweb socket, giving an 'invalid_bind_address' error. This
should help users who have specified a hostname or made a typo as the
original error was less helpful.

Fix as suggested by Dave Cottlehuber.

Commit message - Changing "Install as Couchapp" instructions

The instructions didn't work for me. I also prefer not installing node modules globally.

I also removed the step of building CouchDB as I'd expect most people that want to run it as a CouchApp already have a couch installed.

Commit message - Add couch_httpd_misc_handlers:handle_file_req

This can be used to serve up files like /crossdomain.xml from a
CouchDB instance. For example, you could add:

    [httpd_global_handlers]
    crossdomain.xml = {couch_httpd_misc_handlers, handle_file_req, "/usr/share/couchdb/www/crossdomain.xml" }

To your local.ini to serve up crossdomain.xml.

Commit message - WIP: flesh out doc CRUD, add notifications, fix glyphs

Start working on making the transitions between all docs and docs
functional. Added in logic for save docs to check for valid code and
either add a fail warning or saving notification.

Added in notion of a pageUrl, which is a way for a model to define
where it is located in terms of a REST resource. There is a fair bit
of overlap with the url function, but not always, and its relative vs
absolute. I'm not a huge fan of the way pageUrl is setup and
constructed right now, but we do need a way for a modal to define
where its accessible in the app. Ie given a database or a doc, you can
provide a route compatible url that will get you to the relevant page
for that item.

We should also consider restructuring the application urls to be more
restful and not necessarily map directly to the couchdb urls, as we
have the api bar down on the bottom which does a much better job.
Things like listing all databases should potentially just be
/databases in the url as /databases/_all_dbs is akward, and becomes
tricky to distinguish between /databases/_design%2Fasdf.

Another related option is setting up a route
/databases/_design/:ddoc_id that will allow us to explicitly handle
design docs and we can use a different default view. For instance, on
normal docs, I prefer to see the code editor JSON, but on ddocs I
would like to see a higher level representation.

I temporarily added in div.view.show to make the styling and buttons
work on the _all_docs list, but we should replace that and move away
from that model.

Also fixed image copying in the build so the glyph icons work now, and
any other images will now be there as well.

Added a notification API allowing you to set a msg, notification type,
and optionally specify a target or by default just use a global notifier.

Commit message - Functional doc save and delete, also Ctrl-s support

Save and delete functionality is now working. Added in some additional
notification pieces such as a fade timer and a clear all flag.

Also, document editor now supports Ctrl-s for saving, because, hell yeah.

Commit message - Document CRUD functionality

Lots of document CRUD updates. Most operations are in place and
functional now.

Two large issues this work uncovered.

1) Shared state between "urls." URLs imply a different stateful
resource, but when resources can be shared between multiple pages,
then the notion of mapping actions to URLs is less useful, and becomes
more complicated. For instance, the doc editor provides both a code
editor and a field editor, binding the data between the two gets
tricky as the two editors are different pages and different URLs. In
this case, we want to be able to share state between different child
pages, or more generally, we want the ability to share state between
subtabs and subpages.

2) When you have pages and subpages with nearly identical structure,
we still have a huge amount of duplicated boilerplate. For instance
the code and field editors use the same overall structure, but one
view is swapped out. We should have a way to remove the duplicated
boiler plate allowing each of those pages to be easily gernerated.
Alternatively, we could have subpages define what views they want to
swap out, and just extend from a parent page.

This commit has a handful of other random changes, like switching
pageUrl to just url with an optional context for switching on.

Commit message - Use non-compressed Content-Type in attachments test suites

MD5-Digests of attachments are calculated on the compressed data if the
attachment MIME type is compressible, as defined in default.ini
[attachments] compressible_types

Windows uses a different gzip implementation, and therefore generates
different MD5-Digests than other platforms. Using binary Content-Type
resolves this.

Commit message - Unfix view compaction progress reports

This reverts the compaction task status progress back to what exists on
1.2.x. The issue is that we use the number of documents in the database
instead of the number of docids in the union of all views (the number of
rows in the view's id btree). In this particular case the desire to have
seamless view upgrades outweighs fixing the relatively minor UI bug.

Commit message - Fix CORS error with attachments

When attachments were returned (?attachments=true) while CORS was
enabled and used, an error occured. The reason for this error
were headers that were encoded as binaries instead of lists. String
operations on binaries throw errors.

This commit fixes COUCHDB-1689.

Commit message - Avoid a possible race condition.

The old code was relying on a DOWN message being sent before a call
to get the current ref counter. Its possible that the request was
sent before that happened causing an error.

The new code doesn't use messages from the child process and instead
uses a monitor to know when the process went down. Then it sends
up to 10,000 requests for the current count. Theoretically the only
way this will fail is if the DOWN message to the ref_counter is
delayed for an extremely long time or dropped entirely.

Commit message - faster implementation of pread_iolist. Closes COUCHDB-762

Why it's faster:
- 2 pread() calls (instead of 3) for MD5-prefixed terms
- 1 gen_server:call (instead of 3) in all cases, also guarantees that
we don't intersperse pread() calls to different parts of the file when we
have concurrent readers.

Commit message - Skip recursive path merging, COUCHDB-968

This patch ensures that we only ever merge a linear path into the tree.
It relies on the stemming code to collapse paths that could have been
merged together by a recursive use of merge_one.

Commit message - Make the doc multipart GET APIs always send attachments compressed

For attachments that are stored in compressed (gzip) form, make sure the
document multipart/related and multipart/mixed APIs don't decompress the
attachments before sending them through the socket. This is to avoid multipart
parser issues when the attachment's identity length is unknown or lost due to
a local to local replication triggered by CouchDB versions up to 1.0.1

Closes COUCHDB-1022.

Commit message - Removed unnecessary iolist_to_binary/1 calls

These IOlist to binary conversions are not necessary since ibrowse accepts
IOlists as outputs of streaming functions. Also, having the IOlists getting
converted into binaries by the erts (instead of user Erlang code) is more
efficient.

Commit message - CouchDB no longer requires cURL to build.

cURL is only used by the command line JavaScript test suite
which is not run by a large number of users. This change
no longer requires cURL to be available for all CouchDB
installations.

Thanks to Randall Leeds for the patch.
Closes COUCHDB-1042

Commit message - Adapt replication manager to the new replicator's code

Now all the replication document management is done only by the
couch_replication_manager module, instead of being split by this
module and replication gen_servers. The code is also simpler now,
since it uses the couch_replication_notifier gen_event.

This is a pure refactoring, not adding any new behaviour.

Commit message - Replication manager: fix occasional race conditions

Fix rare race conditions when making the transition of replication states.
These are likely to happen for very short lived replications like the ones in the
test suite, or when deleting or changing the replicator database during runtime.

These race conditions were added in the refactoring done in revision 1079483 (which
adapted the replication manager to the new replicator code).

Commit message - Added ejson application

This is a NIF based JSON decoder/encoder based on Paul Davis' eep0018
implementation (https://github.com/davisp/eep0018/), with some modifications
from Damien (big number support and optimizations) on top, plus a few fixes
from my side and Benoît on top of Damien's fork.
This module fallbacks to mochijson2 when the NIF is not loaded or compiled.
The NIF is only compiled and used if we're using an OTP release >= R13B04.

Thanks everyone. Closes COUCHDB-1118.

Commit message - ejson application init function must return 'true' on R13B03

On OTP R13B03, the function invoked by the "on_load" directive (introduced
in this release) must return the atom 'true' and not 'ok'.
The Erlang preprocessor also seems to ignore any unknown directives, so
the use of the "on_load" directive should not cause compilation errors
on older OTP releases (<= R13B02).

Thanks to Matt Goodall for reporting this and providing a patch.

Commit message - Track used space for database and view index files

The database and view group info URIs now expose a new field, named "data_size",
which corresponds to the number of bytes used by the current data snapshot.
Users can now use this value, compare it to the "disk_size" value (total file size)
and decide whether or not to trigger a compaction based on this comparison.
This new value is an approximation and therefore not 100% accurate (but close enough).

Closes COUCHDB-1132.

Special thanks to Adam Kocoloski and Robert Dionne for they're good work on this
feature as well.

Not only this makes database and view index files smaller it also increases
database read/write performance, view index generation (specially for large
documents and/or documents with nested JSON structures) and compaction.

Commit message - Configurable database and view compaction parameters

These parameters are now configurable as byte quantities.
Larger buffer sizes can significantly decrease final file sizes and
in some cases make the compaction process faster or slower.

Commit message - Bug fix in couch_work_queue: state's size not decremented

When dequeing some items from the queue (that is, not taking all the queued items)
the size field of the gen_server's state was not being decremented as it should.
However when all the queue items are delivered to a consumer, the size is set to 0.

This particular fix has a good impact in the new replicator because it uses work queues
and the consumers only dequeue 1 item at a time - producers will no longer be blocked
until the queue gets empty.
For a push replication that used to take about 15 minutes, it now takes about 13 minutes.

Commit message - Call traversal handlers in btree folds

Previously the fold function was only invoked for leafs.
With this change it's possible to define a fold function which is called
for inner nodes and can return a tuple {skip, Acc} in order to skip
exploration of the branch.

Commit message - Add configurable automatic compaction

A set of rules can now be defined in order to automatically
trigger the compaction of databases and their views. This
configuration can be global or overrided for specific
databases. By default it's disabled. Enabling it can be
done via the .ini configuration by simply adding global
or database specific compaction rules.

Closes COUCHDB-1153.
Thanks everyone involved who gave feedback and suggestions
for improvements.

Commit message - Efficient implementation of builtin filters

Currently, the builtin changes filters "_doc_ids" and "_design"
are not very efficient because they fold the entire seq btree
and then filter the values by document ID.
This implementation avoids that by doing direct lookups against
the id btree, and then, for continuous changes requests, it
just listens for database update events and does partial seq
btree folds.

Commit message - More efficient communication with the view server

This change makes the communication between the Erlang VM and
an external view server (couchjs for e.g.) more efficient by
writing a series of commands into the port and reading all the
responses from the external view server after doing all those
writes. This minimizes the amount of time each endpoint spends
blocked reading from the port.

Commit message - COUCHDB-1380 Revert "Better logger performance"

This reverts commit 9f2398faef3936a844caffbaf3eef8675383ccfd which
switched couch_log to use disk_log. Unfortunately that module performs
positioned writes which prevents the usual logrotation strategy from
working correctly.

Commit message - Fix SpiderMonkey version detection

Randall's last patch to only test for JSOPTION_ANONFUNFIX ended up
reordering the test before the headers were located. This ran into
errors in version detection. This patch reorders the header location as
well as adds a few more default search paths when no --with-js-include
option is specified to account for newer SpiderMonkeys that puth their
headers into $PREFIX/include/js.

Commit message - Ensure compaction respects compression setting

For a database with file format version 6 (CouchDB 1.2+), if
the file_compression setting was changed, compaction ignored
it, making it impossible to change the compression method of
a database and its indexes.

Commit message - COUCHDB-111 handle multiple files in couchjs

Rather than concatenating all the input files and compiling them into a
script with the name '<multiple files>', compile each one and execute
it with the same globals.

This change is intended to aide in COUCHDB-111 by preserving file name
and line number information when executing scripts.

Commit message - Fix random failures in replication.js test

This should fix the random failures for the 'expected "25" got "31"
error message that pops up occasionally. If my hunch is correct when we
remove the two docs from the source db its possible to get the writes on
the target out of order depending on a race condition.

This just sleeps a bit in between the deletions to try and reduce that
possibility. I haven't spotted this error after applying this patch.

Commit message - Avoid possible timeout initializing replications

If 2 different replications start and finish at about the same
time, there's a chance one is doing a synchronous gen_server
call to the replication manager (to notify it that it started)
while the replication manager is doing a call to the replication
supervisor because the other replication just finished.

Commit message - Handle ddoc_updated event correctly.

COUCHDB-1309 introduced a new update event of the form {ddoc_updated,
{DbName, DDocId}}. Unfortunately it did not update
couch_db_update_notifier with a clause that can marshal this to JSON
successfully, breaking all uses of [update_notification]

This commit improves event encoding so that the above renders as
{"type":"ddoc_updated","db":"DbName","id":"DDocId"}

This patch validate the bind_address value before attempting to bind

should help users who have specified a hostname or made a typo as the
original error was less helpful.

Fix as suggested by Dave Cottlehuber.

Commit message - Changing "Install as Couchapp" instructions

The instructions didn't work for me. I also prefer not installing node modules globally.

I also removed the step of building CouchDB as I'd expect most people that want to run it as a CouchApp already have a couch installed.

Commit message - WIP: flesh out doc CRUD, add notifications, fix glyphs

Start working on making the transitions between all docs and docs
functional. Added in logic for save docs to check for valid code and
either add a fail warning or saving notification.

Added in notion of a pageUrl, which is a way for a model to define
where it is located in terms of a REST resource. There is a fair bit
of overlap with the url function, but not always, and its relative vs
absolute. I'm not a huge fan of the way pageUrl is setup and
constructed right now, but we do need a way for a modal to define
where its accessible in the app. Ie given a database or a doc, you can
provide a route compatible url that will get you to the relevant page
for that item.

We should also consider restructuring the application urls to be more
restful and not necessarily map directly to the couchdb urls, as we
have the api bar down on the bottom which does a much better job.
Things like listing all databases should potentially just be
/databases in the url as /databases/_all_dbs is akward, and becomes
tricky to distinguish between /databases/_design%2Fasdf.

Another related option is setting up a route
/databases/_design/:ddoc_id that will allow us to explicitly handle
design docs and we can use a different default view. For instance, on
normal docs, I prefer to see the code editor JSON, but on ddocs I
would like to see a higher level representation.

I temporarily added in div.view.show to make the styling and buttons
work on the _all_docs list, but we should replace that and move away
from that model.

Also fixed image copying in the build so the glyph icons work now, and
any other images will now be there as well.

Added a notification API allowing you to set a msg, notification type,
and optionally specify a target or by default just use a global notifier.

Commit message - Document CRUD functionality

Lots of document CRUD updates. Most operations are in place and
functional now.

Two large issues this work uncovered.

1) Shared state between "urls." URLs imply a different stateful
resource, but when resources can be shared between multiple pages,
then the notion of mapping actions to URLs is less useful, and becomes
more complicated. For instance, the doc editor provides both a code
editor and a field editor, binding the data between the two gets
tricky as the two editors are different pages and different URLs. In
this case, we want to be able to share state between different child
pages, or more generally, we want the ability to share state between
subtabs and subpages.

2) When you have pages and subpages with nearly identical structure,
we still have a huge amount of duplicated boilerplate. For instance
the code and field editors use the same overall structure, but one
view is swapped out. We should have a way to remove the duplicated
boiler plate allowing each of those pages to be easily gernerated.
Alternatively, we could have subpages define what views they want to
swap out, and just extend from a parent page.

This commit has a handful of other random changes, like switching
pageUrl to just url with an optional context for switching on.

Commit message - Unfix view compaction progress reports

This reverts the compaction task status progress back to what exists on
1.2.x. The issue is that we use the number of documents in the database
instead of the number of docids in the union of all views (the number of
rows in the view's id btree). In this particular case the desire to have
seamless view upgrades outweighs fixing the relatively minor UI bug.

Commit message - Fix CORS error with attachments

When attachments were returned (?attachments=true) while CORS was
enabled and used, an error occured. The reason for this error
were headers that were encoded as binaries instead of lists. String
operations on binaries throw errors.

This commit fixes COUCHDB-1689.

Commit message - Import couch_dbupdates from rcouch.

This creates a new top level API endpoint: `/_db_updates`
that returns a line of JSON for each database event along
with the database name.

A database event is one of `created`, `updated`, `deleted`.

The API endpoint supports a `?feed=` parameter with the
options: `longpoll`, `continuous` and `eventsource`.

A second parameter `timeout=` specifies when the server should
close the connection.

`longpoll` closes the connection after a single notification.
It is the default option.

`continuous` keeps a socket open until the specified `timeout`
or 60 seconds by default.

`heartbeat` decides whether to send a newline character on
`timeout` to avoid clients closing the connection prematurely.

`eventsource` works like continuous, but sends the data in
EventSource format. See http://dev.w3.org/html5/eventsource/

The parameters are modelled after the existing `/_changes` API
endpoint. Note that `/_db_updates` does not support resuming
of notifications via a sequence ID.

This is a port of the existing DbUpdateNotification interface
to the HTTP API.

Functional changes compared to rcouch:

 - make _db_updates an admin-only resource

Docs:

 - updated api/misc to include basic info on `/_db_updates`

License:

  Apache 2 license, updated LICENSE.

Notice:

  (c) 2012 Benoit Chesneau, updated NOTICE.

Tests:

 - only manual testing of the various API differences due to
   complications with asynchronous HTTP requests in the JS
   test suite and total annoyance of overly complicated
   ibrowse/httpc modules for writing etap tests.

Recommendation to ship this as EXPERIMENTAL until we have tests.

Commit message - Use non-compressed Content-Type in attachments test suites

MD5-Digests of attachments are calculated on the compressed data if the
attachment MIME type is compressible, as defined in default.ini
[attachments] compressible_types

Windows uses a different gzip implementation, and therefore generates
different MD5-Digests than other platforms. Using binary Content-Type
resolves this.

Commit message - Fix `make check-js` for non-`make` builds.

This patch passes the `$(MAKE)` value to `test/javascript/run`
so it can in turn invoke `$(MAKE)` instead of literal `make`,
so builds that use e.g. `gmake` succeed.

Commit message - A portable way to populate THANKS.

In particular:
 - BSD sed and GNU sed dosagree on commandline options.
 - echo "\n" >> FILE or "\r\n" for that matter, does not create a
   newline in FILE on Windows.

Original patch by Christopher Bonhage, applied with slight modification.

Commit message - Do not log errors on creating new view index.

While view index file may be really missed, it's ok for new views
and this error will be self-healed on next couch_file:open call
so there is no reason to worry user about.

Commit message - COUCHDB-1654: Transparently update view signatures from <= 1.2.x.

Updates 1.2.x or earlier view files to 1.3.x or later view files
transparently, the first time the 1.2.x view file is opened by
1.3.x or later.

Here's how it works:

Before opening a view index,
If no matching index file is found in the new location:
 calculate the <= 1.2.x view signature
 if a file with that signature lives in the old location
   copy it to the new location with the new signature in the name.
Then proceed to open the view index as usual.
After opening, read its header.

If the header matches the <= 1.2.x style #index_header record:
  upgrade the header to the new #mrheader record
The next time the view is used, the new header is used.

If we crash after the rename, but before the header upgrade,
  the header upgrade is done on the next view opening.

If we crash between upgrading to the new header and writing
  that header to disk, we start with the old header again,
  do the upgrade and write to disk.

Includes etap tests in 250*.t.

Commit message - Unfix view compaction progress reports

This reverts the compaction task status progress back to what exists on
1.2.x. The issue is that we use the number of documents in the database
instead of the number of docids in the union of all views (the number of
rows in the view's id btree). In this particular case the desire to have
seamless view upgrades outweighs fixing the relatively minor UI bug.

Commit message - Only allow strings in user doc "roles" array

We validate that _security documents only contain strings but we have
not done the same for the roles field in user docs. This is a breaking
change as users may have been inserting other things (notably,
objects) in this field.

Commit message - Fix CORS error with attachments

When attachments were returned (?attachments=true) while CORS was
enabled and used, an error occured. The reason for this error
were headers that were encoded as binaries instead of lists. String
operations on binaries throw errors.

This commit fixes COUCHDB-1689.

Commit message - Use non-compressed Content-Type in attachments test suites

MD5-Digests of attachments are calculated on the compressed data if the
attachment MIME type is compressible, as defined in default.ini
[attachments] compressible_types

Windows uses a different gzip implementation, and therefore generates
different MD5-Digests than other platforms. Using binary Content-Type
resolves this.

Commit message - Fix `make check-js` for non-`make` builds.

This patch passes the `$(MAKE)` value to `test/javascript/run`
so it can in turn invoke `$(MAKE)` instead of literal `make`,
so builds that use e.g. `gmake` succeed.

While view index file may be really missed, it's ok for new views
and this error will be self-healed on next couch_file:open call

Commit message - COUCHDB-1654: Transparently update view signatures from <= 1.2.x.

Updates 1.2.x or earlier view files to 1.3.x or later view files
transparently, the first time the 1.2.x view file is opened by
1.3.x or later.

Here's how it works:

Before opening a view index,
If no matching index file is found in the new location:
 calculate the <= 1.2.x view signature
 if a file with that signature lives in the old location
   copy it to the new location with the new signature in the name.
Then proceed to open the view index as usual.
After opening, read its header.

If the header matches the <= 1.2.x style #index_header record:
  upgrade the header to the new #mrheader record
The next time the view is used, the new header is used.

If we crash after the rename, but before the header upgrade,
  the header upgrade is done on the next view opening.

If we crash between upgrading to the new header and writing
  that header to disk, we start with the old header again,
  do the upgrade and write to disk.

Includes etap tests in 250*.t.

Commit message - Unfix view compaction progress reports

This reverts the compaction task status progress back to what exists on
1.2.x. The issue is that we use the number of documents in the database
instead of the number of docids in the union of all views (the number of
rows in the view's id btree). In this particular case the desire to have
seamless view upgrades outweighs fixing the relatively minor UI bug.

Commit message - Only allow strings in user doc "roles" array

We validate that _security documents only contain strings but we have
not done the same for the roles field in user docs. This is a breaking
change as users may have been inserting other things (notably,
objects) in this field.

Commit message - Fix CORS error with attachments

When attachments were returned (?attachments=true) while CORS was
enabled and used, an error occured. The reason for this error
were headers that were encoded as binaries instead of lists. String
operations on binaries throw errors.

This commit fixes COUCHDB-1689.

MD5-Digests of attachments are calculated on the compressed data if the
attachment MIME type is compressible, as defined in default.ini
[attachments] compressible_types

Windows uses a different gzip implementation, and therefore generates
different MD5-Digests than other platforms. Using binary Content-Type
resolves this.

Commit message - Fix `make check-js` for non-`make` builds.

This patch passes the `$(MAKE)` value to `test/javascript/run`
so it can in turn invoke `$(MAKE)` instead of literal `make`,
so builds that use e.g. `gmake` succeed.

In particular:
 - BSD sed and GNU sed dosagree on commandline options.
 - echo "\n" >> FILE or "\r\n" for that matter, does not create a
   newline in FILE on Windows.

Original patch by Christopher Bonhage, applied with slight modification.

Commit message - COUCHDB-1654: Transparently update view signatures from <= 1.2.x.

Updates 1.2.x or earlier view files to 1.3.x or later view files
transparently, the first time the 1.2.x view file is opened by
1.3.x or later.

Here's how it works:

Before opening a view index,
If no matching index file is found in the new location:
 calculate the <= 1.2.x view signature
 if a file with that signature lives in the old location
   copy it to the new location with the new signature in the name.
Then proceed to open the view index as usual.
After opening, read its header.

If the header matches the <= 1.2.x style #index_header record:
  upgrade the header to the new #mrheader record
The next time the view is used, the new header is used.

If we crash after the rename, but before the header upgrade,
  the header upgrade is done on the next view opening.

If we crash between upgrading to the new header and writing
  that header to disk, we start with the old header again,
  do the upgrade and write to disk.

Includes etap tests in 250*.t.

Commit message - Unfix view compaction progress reports

This reverts the compaction task status progress back to what exists on
1.2.x. The issue is that we use the number of documents in the database
instead of the number of docids in the union of all views (the number of
rows in the view's id btree). In this particular case the desire to have
seamless view upgrades outweighs fixing the relatively minor UI bug.

Commit message - Only allow strings in user doc "roles" array

We validate that _security documents only contain strings but we have
not done the same for the roles field in user docs. This is a breaking
change as users may have been inserting other things (notably,
objects) in this field.

Commit message - Reset rewrite counter on new request

We were spuriously throwing rewrite limit exceeded for non-looping
rewrites. This patch resets the count to zero at the start of a new
request and adds a test.

Commit message - Fix CORS error with attachments

When attachments were returned (?attachments=true) while CORS was
enabled and used, an error occured. The reason for this error
were headers that were encoded as binaries instead of lists. String
operations on binaries throw errors.

This commit fixes COUCHDB-1689.

Commit message - Fix: documentation contains GeoCouch specifics

The original Couchbase documentation also contained information
about GeoCouch. Apache CouchDB doesn't include GeoCouch, hence

Commit message - Fix `make check-js` for non-`make` builds.

This patch passes the `$(MAKE)` value to `test/javascript/run`
so it can in turn invoke `$(MAKE)` instead of literal `make`,
so builds that use e.g. `gmake` succeed.

 - echo "\n" >> FILE or "\r\n" for that matter, does not create a
   newline in FILE on Windows.

Original patch by Christopher Bonhage, applied with slight modification.

Commit message - COUCHDB-1654: Transparently update view signatures from <= 1.2.x.

Updates 1.2.x or earlier view files to 1.3.x or later view files
transparently, the first time the 1.2.x view file is opened by
1.3.x or later.

Here's how it works:

Before opening a view index,
If no matching index file is found in the new location:
 calculate the <= 1.2.x view signature
 if a file with that signature lives in the old location
   copy it to the new location with the new signature in the name.
Then proceed to open the view index as usual.
After opening, read its header.

If the header matches the <= 1.2.x style #index_header record:
  upgrade the header to the new #mrheader record
The next time the view is used, the new header is used.

If we crash after the rename, but before the header upgrade,
  the header upgrade is done on the next view opening.

If we crash between upgrading to the new header and writing
  that header to disk, we start with the old header again,
  do the upgrade and write to disk.

Includes etap tests in 250*.t.

Commit message - Unfix view compaction progress reports

This reverts the compaction task status progress back to what exists on
1.2.x. The issue is that we use the number of documents in the database
instead of the number of docids in the union of all views (the number of
rows in the view's id btree). In this particular case the desire to have
seamless view upgrades outweighs fixing the relatively minor UI bug.

Commit message - Only allow strings in user doc "roles" array

We validate that _security documents only contain strings but we have
not done the same for the roles field in user docs. This is a breaking
change as users may have been inserting other things (notably,
objects) in this field.

Commit message - Reset rewrite counter on new request

We were spuriously throwing rewrite limit exceeded for non-looping
rewrites. This patch resets the count to zero at the start of a new
request and adds a test.

Commit message - Fix CORS error with attachments

When attachments were returned (?attachments=true) while CORS was
enabled and used, an error occured. The reason for this error
were headers that were encoded as binaries instead of lists. String
operations on binaries throw errors.

This commit fixes COUCHDB-1689.

Commit message - Fix: documentation contains GeoCouch specifics

The original Couchbase documentation also contained information
about GeoCouch. Apache CouchDB doesn't include GeoCouch, hence
there should be no trace of it left in the documentation.

Commit message - Use non-compressed Content-Type in attachments test suites

MD5-Digests of attachments are calculated on the compressed data if the
attachment MIME type is compressible, as defined in default.ini
[attachments] compressible_types

Windows uses a different gzip implementation, and therefore generates
different MD5-Digests than other platforms. Using binary Content-Type
resolves this.

Commit message - Fix `make check-js` for non-`make` builds.

This patch passes the `$(MAKE)` value to `test/javascript/run`
so it can in turn invoke `$(MAKE)` instead of literal `make`,
so builds that use e.g. `gmake` succeed.

Commit message - Do not log errors on creating new view index.

While view index file may be really missed, it's ok for new views
and this error will be self-healed on next couch_file:open call
so there is no reason to worry user about.

Commit message - COUCHDB-1654: Transparently update view signatures from <= 1.2.x.

Updates 1.2.x or earlier view files to 1.3.x or later view files
transparently, the first time the 1.2.x view file is opened by
1.3.x or later.

Here's how it works:

Before opening a view index,
If no matching index file is found in the new location:
 calculate the <= 1.2.x view signature
 if a file with that signature lives in the old location
   copy it to the new location with the new signature in the name.
Then proceed to open the view index as usual.
After opening, read its header.

If the header matches the <= 1.2.x style #index_header record:
  upgrade the header to the new #mrheader record
The next time the view is used, the new header is used.

If we crash after the rename, but before the header upgrade,
  the header upgrade is done on the next view opening.

If we crash between upgrading to the new header and writing
  that header to disk, we start with the old header again,
  do the upgrade and write to disk.

Includes etap tests in 250*.t.

Commit message - Unfix view compaction progress reports

This reverts the compaction task status progress back to what exists on
1.2.x. The issue is that we use the number of documents in the database
instead of the number of docids in the union of all views (the number of
rows in the view's id btree). In this particular case the desire to have
seamless view upgrades outweighs fixing the relatively minor UI bug.

Commit message - Only allow strings in user doc "roles" array

We validate that _security documents only contain strings but we have
not done the same for the roles field in user docs. This is a breaking
change as users may have been inserting other things (notably,
objects) in this field.

Commit message - Fix CORS error with attachments

When attachments were returned (?attachments=true) while CORS was
enabled and used, an error occured. The reason for this error
were headers that were encoded as binaries instead of lists. String
operations on binaries throw errors.

This commit fixes COUCHDB-1689.

[attachments] compressible_types

Windows uses a different gzip implementation, and therefore generates
different MD5-Digests than other platforms. Using binary Content-Type
resolves this.

Commit message - Fix `make check-js` for non-`make` builds.

This patch passes the `$(MAKE)` value to `test/javascript/run`
so it can in turn invoke `$(MAKE)` instead of literal `make`,
so builds that use e.g. `gmake` succeed.

Commit message - COUCHDB-1654: Transparently update view signatures from <= 1.2.x.

Updates 1.2.x or earlier view files to 1.3.x or later view files
transparently, the first time the 1.2.x view file is opened by
1.3.x or later.

Here's how it works:

Before opening a view index,
If no matching index file is found in the new location:
 calculate the <= 1.2.x view signature
 if a file with that signature lives in the old location
   copy it to the new location with the new signature in the name.
Then proceed to open the view index as usual.
After opening, read its header.

If the header matches the <= 1.2.x style #index_header record:
  upgrade the header to the new #mrheader record
The next time the view is used, the new header is used.

If we crash after the rename, but before the header upgrade,
  the header upgrade is done on the next view opening.

If we crash between upgrading to the new header and writing
  that header to disk, we start with the old header again,
  do the upgrade and write to disk.

Includes etap tests in 250*.t.

Commit message - Unfix view compaction progress reports

rows in the view's id btree). In this particular case the desire to have
seamless view upgrades outweighs fixing the relatively minor UI bug.

Commit message - Only allow strings in user doc "roles" array

We validate that _security documents only contain strings but we have
not done the same for the roles field in user docs. This is a breaking
change as users may have been inserting other things (notably,
objects) in this field.

Commit message - Reset rewrite counter on new request

We were spuriously throwing rewrite limit exceeded for non-looping
rewrites. This patch resets the count to zero at the start of a new
request and adds a test.

Commit message - Fix CORS error with attachments

When attachments were returned (?attachments=true) while CORS was
enabled and used, an error occured. The reason for this error
were headers that were encoded as binaries instead of lists. String
operations on binaries throw errors.

This commit fixes COUCHDB-1689.

Commit message - Fix: documentation contains GeoCouch specifics

The original Couchbase documentation also contained information
about GeoCouch. Apache CouchDB doesn't include GeoCouch, hence
there should be no trace of it left in the documentation.

Commit message - Use non-compressed Content-Type in attachments test suites

MD5-Digests of attachments are calculated on the compressed data if the
attachment MIME type is compressible, as defined in default.ini
[attachments] compressible_types

Windows uses a different gzip implementation, and therefore generates
different MD5-Digests than other platforms. Using binary Content-Type
resolves this.

Commit message - Fix `make check-js` for non-`make` builds.

This patch passes the `$(MAKE)` value to `test/javascript/run`
so it can in turn invoke `$(MAKE)` instead of literal `make`,
so builds that use e.g. `gmake` succeed.

In particular:
 - BSD sed and GNU sed dosagree on commandline options.
 - echo "\n" >> FILE or "\r\n" for that matter, does not create a
   newline in FILE on Windows.

Commit message - Do not log errors on creating new view index.

While view index file may be really missed, it's ok for new views
and this error will be self-healed on next couch_file:open call
so there is no reason to worry user about.

Commit message - COUCHDB-1654: Transparently update view signatures from <= 1.2.x.

Updates 1.2.x or earlier view files to 1.3.x or later view files
transparently, the first time the 1.2.x view file is opened by
1.3.x or later.

Here's how it works:

Before opening a view index,
If no matching index file is found in the new location:
 calculate the <= 1.2.x view signature
 if a file with that signature lives in the old location
   copy it to the new location with the new signature in the name.
Then proceed to open the view index as usual.
After opening, read its header.

If the header matches the <= 1.2.x style #index_header record:
  upgrade the header to the new #mrheader record
The next time the view is used, the new header is used.

If we crash after the rename, but before the header upgrade,
  the header upgrade is done on the next view opening.

If we crash between upgrading to the new header and writing
  that header to disk, we start with the old header again,
  do the upgrade and write to disk.

Includes etap tests in 250*.t.

Commit message - Unfix view compaction progress reports

This reverts the compaction task status progress back to what exists on
1.2.x. The issue is that we use the number of documents in the database
instead of the number of docids in the union of all views (the number of
rows in the view's id btree). In this particular case the desire to have
seamless view upgrades outweighs fixing the relatively minor UI bug.

Commit message - Only allow strings in user doc "roles" array

We validate that _security documents only contain strings but we have
not done the same for the roles field in user docs. This is a breaking
change as users may have been inserting other things (notably,
objects) in this field.

Commit message - Fix CORS error with attachments

When attachments were returned (?attachments=true) while CORS was
enabled and used, an error occured. The reason for this error
were headers that were encoded as binaries instead of lists. String
operations on binaries throw errors.

This commit fixes COUCHDB-1689.

Commit message - Use non-compressed Content-Type in attachments test suites

MD5-Digests of attachments are calculated on the compressed data if the
attachment MIME type is compressible, as defined in default.ini
[attachments] compressible_types

Windows uses a different gzip implementation, and therefore generates
different MD5-Digests than other platforms. Using binary Content-Type
resolves this.

Commit message - Fix `make check-js` for non-`make` builds.

This patch passes the `$(MAKE)` value to `test/javascript/run`
so it can in turn invoke `$(MAKE)` instead of literal `make`,
so builds that use e.g. `gmake` succeed.

Commit message - COUCHDB-1654: Transparently update view signatures from <= 1.2.x.

Updates 1.2.x or earlier view files to 1.3.x or later view files
transparently, the first time the 1.2.x view file is opened by
1.3.x or later.

Here's how it works:

Before opening a view index,
If no matching index file is found in the new location:
 calculate the <= 1.2.x view signature
 if a file with that signature lives in the old location
   copy it to the new location with the new signature in the name.
Then proceed to open the view index as usual.
After opening, read its header.

If the header matches the <= 1.2.x style #index_header record:
  upgrade the header to the new #mrheader record
The next time the view is used, the new header is used.

If we crash after the rename, but before the header upgrade,
  the header upgrade is done on the next view opening.

If we crash between upgrading to the new header and writing
  that header to disk, we start with the old header again,
  do the upgrade and write to disk.

Includes etap tests in 250*.t.

Commit message - Unfix view compaction progress reports

This reverts the compaction task status progress back to what exists on
1.2.x. The issue is that we use the number of documents in the database
instead of the number of docids in the union of all views (the number of
rows in the view's id btree). In this particular case the desire to have
seamless view upgrades outweighs fixing the relatively minor UI bug.

Commit message - Only allow strings in user doc "roles" array

We validate that _security documents only contain strings but we have
not done the same for the roles field in user docs. This is a breaking
change as users may have been inserting other things (notably,
objects) in this field.

Commit message - Fix CORS error with attachments

When attachments were returned (?attachments=true) while CORS was
enabled and used, an error occured. The reason for this error
were headers that were encoded as binaries instead of lists. String
operations on binaries throw errors.

This commit fixes COUCHDB-1689.

Commit message - Use non-compressed Content-Type in attachments test suites

MD5-Digests of attachments are calculated on the compressed data if the
attachment MIME type is compressible, as defined in default.ini
[attachments] compressible_types

Windows uses a different gzip implementation, and therefore generates
different MD5-Digests than other platforms. Using binary Content-Type
resolves this.

Commit message - Fix `make check-js` for non-`make` builds.

This patch passes the `$(MAKE)` value to `test/javascript/run`
so it can in turn invoke `$(MAKE)` instead of literal `make`,
so builds that use e.g. `gmake` succeed.

Commit message - Do not log errors on creating new view index.

While view index file may be really missed, it's ok for new views
and this error will be self-healed on next couch_file:open call
so there is no reason to worry user about.

Commit message - COUCHDB-1654: Transparently update view signatures from <= 1.2.x.

Updates 1.2.x or earlier view files to 1.3.x or later view files
transparently, the first time the 1.2.x view file is opened by
1.3.x or later.

Here's how it works:

Before opening a view index,
If no matching index file is found in the new location:
 calculate the <= 1.2.x view signature
 if a file with that signature lives in the old location
   copy it to the new location with the new signature in the name.
Then proceed to open the view index as usual.
After opening, read its header.

If the header matches the <= 1.2.x style #index_header record:
  upgrade the header to the new #mrheader record
The next time the view is used, the new header is used.

If we crash after the rename, but before the header upgrade,
  the header upgrade is done on the next view opening.

If we crash between upgrading to the new header and writing
  that header to disk, we start with the old header again,
  do the upgrade and write to disk.

Includes etap tests in 250*.t.

Commit message - Unfix view compaction progress reports

This reverts the compaction task status progress back to what exists on
1.2.x. The issue is that we use the number of documents in the database
instead of the number of docids in the union of all views (the number of
rows in the view's id btree). In this particular case the desire to have
seamless view upgrades outweighs fixing the relatively minor UI bug.

Commit message - Only allow strings in user doc "roles" array

We validate that _security documents only contain strings but we have
not done the same for the roles field in user docs. This is a breaking
change as users may have been inserting other things (notably,
objects) in this field.

were headers that were encoded as binaries instead of lists. String

Commit message - Use non-compressed Content-Type in attachments test suites

MD5-Digests of attachments are calculated on the compressed data if the
attachment MIME type is compressible, as defined in default.ini
[attachments] compressible_types

Windows uses a different gzip implementation, and therefore generates
different MD5-Digests than other platforms. Using binary Content-Type
resolves this.

Commit message - Fix `make check-js` for non-`make` builds.

This patch passes the `$(MAKE)` value to `test/javascript/run`
so it can in turn invoke `$(MAKE)` instead of literal `make`,
so builds that use e.g. `gmake` succeed.

Commit message - Do not log errors on creating new view index.

While view index file may be really missed, it's ok for new views
and this error will be self-healed on next couch_file:open call
so there is no reason to worry user about.

Commit message - COUCHDB-1654: Transparently update view signatures from <= 1.2.x.

Updates 1.2.x or earlier view files to 1.3.x or later view files
transparently, the first time the 1.2.x view file is opened by
1.3.x or later.

Here's how it works:

Before opening a view index,
If no matching index file is found in the new location:
 calculate the <= 1.2.x view signature
 if a file with that signature lives in the old location
   copy it to the new location with the new signature in the name.
Then proceed to open the view index as usual.
After opening, read its header.

If the header matches the <= 1.2.x style #index_header record:
  upgrade the header to the new #mrheader record
The next time the view is used, the new header is used.

If we crash after the rename, but before the header upgrade,
  the header upgrade is done on the next view opening.

If we crash between upgrading to the new header and writing
  that header to disk, we start with the old header again,
  do the upgrade and write to disk.

Includes etap tests in 250*.t.

Commit message - Unfix view compaction progress reports

This reverts the compaction task status progress back to what exists on
1.2.x. The issue is that we use the number of documents in the database
instead of the number of docids in the union of all views (the number of
rows in the view's id btree). In this particular case the desire to have
seamless view upgrades outweighs fixing the relatively minor UI bug.

Commit message - Only allow strings in user doc "roles" array

We validate that _security documents only contain strings but we have
not done the same for the roles field in user docs. This is a breaking
change as users may have been inserting other things (notably,
objects) in this field.

Commit message - Fix CORS error with attachments

When attachments were returned (?attachments=true) while CORS was
enabled and used, an error occured. The reason for this error
were headers that were encoded as binaries instead of lists. String
operations on binaries throw errors.

This commit fixes COUCHDB-1689.

Commit message - Skip recursive path merging, COUCHDB-968

This patch ensures that we only ever merge a linear path into the tree.
It relies on the stemming code to collapse paths that could have been
merged together by a recursive use of merge_one.

Commit message - Make the doc multipart GET APIs always send attachments compressed

For attachments that are stored in compressed (gzip) form, make sure the
document multipart/related and multipart/mixed APIs don't decompress the
attachments before sending them through the socket. This is to avoid multipart
parser issues when the attachment's identity length is unknown or lost due to
a local to local replication triggered by CouchDB versions up to 1.0.1

Closes COUCHDB-1022.

Commit message - Removed unnecessary iolist_to_binary/1 calls

These IOlist to binary conversions are not necessary since ibrowse accepts
IOlists as outputs of streaming functions. Also, having the IOlists getting
converted into binaries by the erts (instead of user Erlang code) is more
efficient.

Commit message - Adapt replication manager to the new replicator's code

Now all the replication document management is done only by the
couch_replication_manager module, instead of being split by this
module and replication gen_servers. The code is also simpler now,
since it uses the couch_replication_notifier gen_event.

This is a pure refactoring, not adding any new behaviour.

Commit message - Replication manager: fix occasional race conditions

Fix rare race conditions when making the transition of replication states.
These are likely to happen for very short lived replications like the ones in the
test suite, or when deleting or changing the replicator database during runtime.

These race conditions were added in the refactoring done in revision 1079483 (which
adapted the replication manager to the new replicator code).

Commit message - Added ejson application

This is a NIF based JSON decoder/encoder based on Paul Davis' eep0018
implementation (https://github.com/davisp/eep0018/), with some modifications
from Damien (big number support and optimizations) on top, plus a few fixes
from my side and Benoît on top of Damien's fork.
This module fallbacks to mochijson2 when the NIF is not loaded or compiled.
The NIF is only compiled and used if we're using an OTP release >= R13B04.

Thanks everyone. Closes COUCHDB-1118.

Commit message - ejson application init function must return 'true' on R13B03

On OTP R13B03, the function invoked by the "on_load" directive (introduced
in this release) must return the atom 'true' and not 'ok'.
The Erlang preprocessor also seems to ignore any unknown directives, so
the use of the "on_load" directive should not cause compilation errors
on older OTP releases (<= R13B02).

Thanks to Matt Goodall for reporting this and providing a patch.

Commit message - Track used space for database and view index files

The database and view group info URIs now expose a new field, named "data_size",
which corresponds to the number of bytes used by the current data snapshot.
Users can now use this value, compare it to the "disk_size" value (total file size)
and decide whether or not to trigger a compaction based on this comparison.
This new value is an approximation and therefore not 100% accurate (but close enough).

Closes COUCHDB-1132.

Special thanks to Adam Kocoloski and Robert Dionne for they're good work on this
feature as well.

Commit message - Bug fix in couch_work_queue: state's size not decremented

When dequeing some items from the queue (that is, not taking all the queued items)
the size field of the gen_server's state was not being decremented as it should.
However when all the queue items are delivered to a consumer, the size is set to 0.

This particular fix has a good impact in the new replicator because it uses work queues
and the consumers only dequeue 1 item at a time - producers will no longer be blocked
until the queue gets empty.
For a push replication that used to take about 15 minutes, it now takes about 13 minutes.

Ignore local database monitor messages. These messages

processes spawn local database monitors but never
do the corresponding erlang:demonitor/1,2 calls.

Commit message - Call traversal handlers in btree folds

Previously the fold function was only invoked for leafs.
With this change it's possible to define a fold function which is called
for inner nodes and can return a tuple {skip, Acc} in order to skip
exploration of the branch.

Commit message - Add configurable automatic compaction

A set of rules can now be defined in order to automatically
trigger the compaction of databases and their views. This
configuration can be global or overrided for specific
databases. By default it's disabled. Enabling it can be
done via the .ini configuration by simply adding global
or database specific compaction rules.

Closes COUCHDB-1153.

for improvements.

Commit message - Efficient implementation of builtin filters

Currently, the builtin changes filters "_doc_ids" and "_design"
are not very efficient because they fold the entire seq btree
and then filter the values by document ID.
This implementation avoids that by doing direct lookups against
the id btree, and then, for continuous changes requests, it
just listens for database update events and does partial seq
btree folds.

Commit message - Fix builtin changes filters with ?descending=true

After a recent optimization (COUCHDB-1288), querying the _changes
feed using one of the builtin filters (_doc_ids, _design) with
?descending=true was not producing the correct results anymore.
This changes fixes it and adds a test.

Commit message - Revert "use couch_db calls instead of couch_btree"

We can't do this without other changes since couch_db:get_design_docs
is hard coded to skip deleted documents, and that's incompatible with
how _changes is supposed to behave.

Commit message - More efficient communication with the view server

This change makes the communication between the Erlang VM and
an external view server (couchjs for e.g.) more efficient by
writing a series of commands into the port and reading all the
responses from the external view server after doing all those
writes. This minimizes the amount of time each endpoint spends
blocked reading from the port.

Commit message - COUCHDB-1380 Revert "Better logger performance"

This reverts commit 9f2398faef3936a844caffbaf3eef8675383ccfd which
switched couch_log to use disk_log. Unfortunately that module performs
positioned writes which prevents the usual logrotation strategy from
working correctly.

Commit message - Fix SpiderMonkey version detection

Randall's last patch to only test for JSOPTION_ANONFUNFIX ended up
reordering the test before the headers were located. This ran into
errors in version detection. This patch reorders the header location as
well as adds a few more default search paths when no --with-js-include
option is specified to account for newer SpiderMonkeys that puth their
headers into $PREFIX/include/js.

Commit message - Ensure compaction respects compression setting

For a database with file format version 6 (CouchDB 1.2+), if
the file_compression setting was changed, compaction ignored
it, making it impossible to change the compression method of
a database and its indexes.

Commit message - COUCHDB-111 handle multiple files in couchjs

Rather than concatenating all the input files and compiling them into a
script with the name '<multiple files>', compile each one and execute
it with the same globals.

This change is intended to aide in COUCHDB-111 by preserving file name
and line number information when executing scripts.

Commit message - Fix random failures in replication.js test

This should fix the random failures for the 'expected "25" got "31"
error message that pops up occasionally. If my hunch is correct when we
remove the two docs from the source db its possible to get the writes on
the target out of order depending on a race condition.

This just sleeps a bit in between the deletions to try and reduce that
possibility. I haven't spotted this error after applying this patch.

Commit message - Avoid possible timeout initializing replications

If 2 different replications start and finish at about the same
time, there's a chance one is doing a synchronous gen_server
call to the replication manager (to notify it that it started)
while the replication manager is doing a call to the replication
supervisor because the other replication just finished.

Commit message - Handle ddoc_updated event correctly.

COUCHDB-1309 introduced a new update event of the form {ddoc_updated,
{DbName, DDocId}}. Unfortunately it did not update
couch_db_update_notifier with a clause that can marshal this to JSON
successfully, breaking all uses of [update_notification]

This commit improves event encoding so that the above renders as
{"type":"ddoc_updated","db":"DbName","id":"DDocId"}

This patch validate the bind_address value before attempting to bind
the mochiweb socket, giving an 'invalid_bind_address' error. This
should help users who have specified a hostname or made a typo as the
original error was less helpful.

Fix as suggested by Dave Cottlehuber.

Commit message - Changing "Install as Couchapp" instructions

The instructions didn't work for me. I also prefer not installing node modules globally.

I also removed the step of building CouchDB as I'd expect most people that want to run it as a CouchApp already have a couch installed.

Commit message - WIP: flesh out doc CRUD, add notifications, fix glyphs

Start working on making the transitions between all docs and docs
functional. Added in logic for save docs to check for valid code and
either add a fail warning or saving notification.

Added in notion of a pageUrl, which is a way for a model to define
where it is located in terms of a REST resource. There is a fair bit
of overlap with the url function, but not always, and its relative vs
absolute. I'm not a huge fan of the way pageUrl is setup and
constructed right now, but we do need a way for a modal to define
where its accessible in the app. Ie given a database or a doc, you can
provide a route compatible url that will get you to the relevant page
for that item.

We should also consider restructuring the application urls to be more
restful and not necessarily map directly to the couchdb urls, as we
have the api bar down on the bottom which does a much better job.
Things like listing all databases should potentially just be
/databases in the url as /databases/_all_dbs is akward, and becomes
tricky to distinguish between /databases/_design%2Fasdf.

Another related option is setting up a route
/databases/_design/:ddoc_id that will allow us to explicitly handle
design docs and we can use a different default view. For instance, on
normal docs, I prefer to see the code editor JSON, but on ddocs I
would like to see a higher level representation.

I temporarily added in div.view.show to make the styling and buttons
work on the _all_docs list, but we should replace that and move away
from that model.

Also fixed image copying in the build so the glyph icons work now, and
any other images will now be there as well.

Added a notification API allowing you to set a msg, notification type,
and optionally specify a target or by default just use a global notifier.

Commit message - Document CRUD functionality

Lots of document CRUD updates. Most operations are in place and
functional now.

Two large issues this work uncovered.

1) Shared state between "urls." URLs imply a different stateful
resource, but when resources can be shared between multiple pages,
then the notion of mapping actions to URLs is less useful, and becomes
more complicated. For instance, the doc editor provides both a code
editor and a field editor, binding the data between the two gets
tricky as the two editors are different pages and different URLs. In
this case, we want to be able to share state between different child
pages, or more generally, we want the ability to share state between
subtabs and subpages.

2) When you have pages and subpages with nearly identical structure,
we still have a huge amount of duplicated boilerplate. For instance
the code and field editors use the same overall structure, but one
view is swapped out. We should have a way to remove the duplicated
boiler plate allowing each of those pages to be easily gernerated.
Alternatively, we could have subpages define what views they want to
swap out, and just extend from a parent page.

This commit has a handful of other random changes, like switching
pageUrl to just url with an optional context for switching on.

Commit message - Unfix view compaction progress reports

This reverts the compaction task status progress back to what exists on
1.2.x. The issue is that we use the number of documents in the database
instead of the number of docids in the union of all views (the number of
rows in the view's id btree). In this particular case the desire to have
seamless view upgrades outweighs fixing the relatively minor UI bug.

Commit message - Fix CORS error with attachments

When attachments were returned (?attachments=true) while CORS was
enabled and used, an error occured. The reason for this error
were headers that were encoded as binaries instead of lists. String
operations on binaries throw errors.

This commit fixes COUCHDB-1689.

Commit message - Changing "Install as Couchapp" instructions

The instructions didn't work for me. I also prefer not installing node modules globally.

I also removed the step of building CouchDB as I'd expect most people that want to run it as a CouchApp already have a couch installed.

Commit message - Consider 'noreply' as a success for quorum check

The new_edits:false option suppresses responses.  We need to account for
that fact when tabulating success replies for the quorum check.  This
fixes a regression in Hodge.

Commit message - Fix stuck internal replications after node down

We weren't removing entries from the dict tracking what was in the job
queue. This looks like a bug after the switch from tuples to the #job{}
record which means its probably been around for quite awhile. Simple fix
is simply to use the correct dict key.

Commit message - One ok implies acceptance

A mixed response of [ok,conflict,conflict] is usually a conflict
response. This patch changes it to an 'accepted' response, since one
of the writes did happen. On high throughput clusters we have observed
spurious [ok,conflict,conflict] responses due to the race with the
internal replicator.

Commit message - Improve intermittent attachment latency

The logic for writing attachments is a fairly simple implementation that
uses a middleman process to split an uploaded attachment stream into N
copies that are consumed on remote nodes. While it is simple and is
quite robust there's no flow control which means that uploads can be
severly limited by the RTT between nodes.

In cases where nodes span a large geographic distance this RTT can add
up to a significant latency for the overall request. While we generally
have two copies in a single datacenter, if one of these closer copies
fails to respond and forces us to use the third distant copy for quorum
the end user will observe "random" latency spikes where in reality we're
just showing them the third copy that is slower to write. This is due to
the fact that each chunk of the attachment upload costs 1 RTT between the
coordinator node and the writer.

This patch addresses the issue by sending all chunks queued in the
middleman that the writer hasn't seen. This reduces the total number of
RTT's by `length(Reply) - 1`.

Commit message - Handle nulls that occur in embedded ids

fabric:docid calls erlang:error if an id is null so it seems like
we should not bother to even spawn a process to call open in this
case as it's a common value from JS errors.

Commit message - Timeout chunked attachment uploads

Its possible that the chunked attachment writers would get lost waiting
to receive a message that never arrived. This would end up leaving an
orphaned process that would hold open database shard copies which
prevented them from being freed by delete_nicely.

This patch just inserts a ten minute time limit waiting for the next
message before it gives up and exits. Its important to note that this is
just the length of time between messages carrying data for the
attachment (which should be about 4K each) and not a time limit for the
entire upload.

Commit message - Fix random failures in replication.js test

This should fix the random failures for the 'expected "25" got "31"
error message that pops up occasionally. If my hunch is correct when we
remove the two docs from the source db its possible to get the writes on
the target out of order depending on a race condition.

This just sleeps a bit in between the deletions to try and reduce that
possibility. I haven't spotted this error after applying this patch.

Commit message - Bubble db not found errors

When requesting the _changes feed of a deleted database with a continuous
or longpoll style we would return a `400 Bad Request` error instead of
the correct `404 Not Found`. This was because we were swallowing all
errors when validating the `since` parameter. This patch just catches
the except and returns it appropriately.

Commit message - Handle rexi_DOWN and rexi_EXIT messages

The controllers now subscribe to rexi_DOWN messages via rexi_monitor.
When a controller receives a message indicating that the rexi_server on
a node is down it assumes all the workers that were supposed to be
spawned by that server are dead.

This patch also adds clauses to handle rexi_EXIT events in a few
coordinators where they were missing.

The db_create and db_delete handlers are not modified by this patch.
We'll deal with them separately as we plan to make some larger-scale
changes to the algorithm there.

Commit message - COUCHDB-1380 Revert "Better logger performance"

This reverts commit 9f2398faef3936a844caffbaf3eef8675383ccfd which
switched couch_log to use disk_log. Unfortunately that module performs
positioned writes which prevents the usual logrotation strategy from
working correctly.

Commit message - Fix SpiderMonkey version detection

Randall's last patch to only test for JSOPTION_ANONFUNFIX ended up
reordering the test before the headers were located. This ran into
errors in version detection. This patch reorders the header location as
well as adds a few more default search paths when no --with-js-include
option is specified to account for newer SpiderMonkeys that puth their
headers into $PREFIX/include/js.

Commit message - Ensure compaction respects compression setting

For a database with file format version 6 (CouchDB 1.2+), if
the file_compression setting was changed, compaction ignored
it, making it impossible to change the compression method of
a database and its indexes.

Commit message - COUCHDB-111 handle multiple files in couchjs

Rather than concatenating all the input files and compiling them into a
script with the name '<multiple files>', compile each one and execute
it with the same globals.

This change is intended to aide in COUCHDB-111 by preserving file name
and line number information when executing scripts.

Commit message - Remove assertion when database compaction finishes

Because the task status is updated only if the time elapsed
since the last task status update is greater than some treshold,
the value of the changes_done property might be smaller than
TotalChanges.

Commit message - Fix random failures in replication.js test

This should fix the random failures for the 'expected "25" got "31"
error message that pops up occasionally. If my hunch is correct when we
remove the two docs from the source db its possible to get the writes on
the target out of order depending on a race condition.

This just sleeps a bit in between the deletions to try and reduce that
possibility. I haven't spotted this error after applying this patch.

Commit message - Manage replications specified in a _replicator DB

This patch adds a manager process that implements the _replicator API
in a BigCouch cluster.  Nodes in the cluster mediate a replication if
the document specifying that replication is stored on a shard whose
primary copy is hosted by that node.

Commit message - Ignore missing databases in update notifier

The most likely cause of this error is that the database was just
deleted.  It's also possible that the partition table is not fully
synchronized across the cluster, but I think this is not the appropriate
place to handle that condition.

Commit message - Fix internal replication hangs on nodeup

The recent patches to eagerly reconnect the cluster when a node boots up
have caused the internal replicators on the other cluster nodes to hang.
Adding rexi_monitor protection around the rexi_call function in the
replicator shows that there is no process named rexi_server on the
freshly booted node.  It seems that the name registration might happen
asynchronously.

This patch adds the aforementioned rexi_monitor protection so that the
replications triggered by the live cluster nodes fail quickly and get
resubmitted once the new node is fully operational.  It has the nice
side effect of also terminating replications against failing nodes more
rapidly.

Zones can now be blacklisted by adding their names to the mem3
"blacklisted_zones" list property. No node in a blacklisted zone
will be chosen when creating databases.

Commit message - Sync _security objects on interactive request

We've known for some time that the _security object can occasionally
diverge across a cluster. This ends up leading to intermittent client
errors as they access different _security settings depending on which
node happens to be handling the request.

This patch works by opening the _security object for all copies of all
shards in the cluster and then checks to see if they are the same object
or not. If there is a single version across the cluster then all is
well. If two versions exist, and the minority are an empty object, then
the majority version is set on all shards in the cluster. Otherwise an
error is logged for human intervention.

Commit message - Ignore missing databases in update notifier

The most likely cause of this error is that the database was just
deleted.  It's also possible that the partition table is not fully
synchronized across the cluster, but I think this is not the appropriate
place to handle that condition.

Commit message - Fix internal replication hangs on nodeup

The recent patches to eagerly reconnect the cluster when a node boots up
have caused the internal replicators on the other cluster nodes to hang.
Adding rexi_monitor protection around the rexi_call function in the
replicator shows that there is no process named rexi_server on the
freshly booted node.  It seems that the name registration might happen
asynchronously.

This patch adds the aforementioned rexi_monitor protection so that the
replications triggered by the live cluster nodes fail quickly and get
resubmitted once the new node is fully operational.  It has the nice
side effect of also terminating replications against failing nodes more
rapidly.

Commit message - Sync _security objects on interactive request

We've known for some time that the _security object can occasionally
diverge across a cluster. This ends up leading to intermittent client
errors as they access different _security settings depending on which
node happens to be handling the request.

This patch works by opening the _security object for all copies of all
shards in the cluster and then checks to see if they are the same object
or not. If there is a single version across the cluster then all is
well. If two versions exist, and the minority are an empty object, then
the majority version is set on all shards in the cluster. Otherwise an
error is logged for human intervention.

Sometimes we want to have workers avoid deferring their casts to a

Commit message - Remove clause that converts error tuple to ok tuple

force_reply/3 now checks for errors like conflict and if all are the same for
a given doc, it uses the value of Health, otherwise an error tuple is returned
and handled in the chttpd layer.

Commit message - Fix callback error handling in fabric:design_docs

fabric_view:remove_down_shards invokes the callback with an error tuple
and expects an ok response, which it returns as an error to the controller.

Commit message - Sync _security objects on interactive request

We've known for some time that the _security object can occasionally
diverge across a cluster. This ends up leading to intermittent client
errors as they access different _security settings depending on which
node happens to be handling the request.

This patch works by opening the _security object for all copies of all
shards in the cluster and then checks to see if they are the same object
or not. If there is a single version across the cluster then all is
well. If two versions exist, and the minority are an empty object, then
the majority version is set on all shards in the cluster. Otherwise an
error is logged for human intervention.

Commit message - Handle rexi_DOWN and rexi_EXIT messages

The controllers now subscribe to rexi_DOWN messages via rexi_monitor.
When a controller receives a message indicating that the rexi_server on
a node is down it assumes all the workers that were supposed to be
spawned by that server are dead.

This patch also adds clauses to handle rexi_EXIT events in a few
coordinators where they were missing.

The db_create and db_delete handlers are not modified by this patch.
We'll deal with them separately as we plan to make some larger-scale
changes to the algorithm there.

Commit message - Handle rexi_DOWN and rexi_EXIT messages

The controllers now subscribe to rexi_DOWN messages via rexi_monitor.
When a controller receives a message indicating that the rexi_server on
a node is down it assumes all the workers that were supposed to be
spawned by that server are dead.

This patch also adds clauses to handle rexi_EXIT events in a few
coordinators where they were missing.

The db_create and db_delete handlers are not modified by this patch.
We'll deal with them separately as we plan to make some larger-scale
changes to the algorithm there.

Commit message - Fix CouchJS compatibility with older Spidermonkey.

The recent patch to enable support for SM 1.8.5 broke support for
1.7.0. This patch updates couchjs to work with all of the major
variants of Spidermonkey.

Versions tested:

    1.7.0
    1.8.0rc1
    1.8.5
    1.9.2.something (XULRunner)

Various combinations have been tested on OS X, Ubuntu, FreeBSD and
Windows.

Fixes COUCHDB-1260

Commit message - Efficient implementation of builtin filters

Currently, the builtin changes filters "_doc_ids" and "_design"
are not very efficient because they fold the entire seq btree
and then filter the values by document ID.
This implementation avoids that by doing direct lookups against
the id btree, and then, for continuous changes requests, it
just listens for database update events and does partial seq
btree folds.

Commit message - Fix internal replication hangs on nodeup

The recent patches to eagerly reconnect the cluster when a node boots up
have caused the internal replicators on the other cluster nodes to hang.
Adding rexi_monitor protection around the rexi_call function in the
replicator shows that there is no process named rexi_server on the
freshly booted node.  It seems that the name registration might happen
asynchronously.

This patch adds the aforementioned rexi_monitor protection so that the
replications triggered by the live cluster nodes fail quickly and get
resubmitted once the new node is fully operational.  It has the nice
side effect of also terminating replications against failing nodes more
rapidly.

Commit message - Fix issue #15 .

Add support for internal `[integer(), binary()]` form of the sequence in
fabric_view_changes:unpack_seqs/2 .

Passing the internal form to since in fabric:changes/4 was causing the
error for some values. This patch fix it.

Commit message - Handle rexi_DOWN and rexi_EXIT messages

The controllers now subscribe to rexi_DOWN messages via rexi_monitor.
When a controller receives a message indicating that the rexi_server on
a node is down it assumes all the workers that were supposed to be
spawned by that server are dead.

This patch also adds clauses to handle rexi_EXIT events in a few
coordinators where they were missing.

The db_create and db_delete handlers are not modified by this patch.
We'll deal with them separately as we plan to make some larger-scale
changes to the algorithm there.

Commit message - Use meck to mock functions for sync repair

Read repair is a side effect of reading a document with inconsistent
revision trees.  The repair has always crashed during testing because it
expects a running server.  It never used to matter, since repair was
async.  But now that we run the repair in-process the tests fail unless
we mock a few functions.

Commit message - Avoid a possible race condition.

The old code was relying on a DOWN message being sent before a call
to get the current ref counter. Its possible that the request was
sent before that happened causing an error.

The new code doesn't use messages from the child process and instead
uses a monitor to know when the process went down. Then it sends
up to 10,000 requests for the current count. Theoretically the only
way this will fail is if the DOWN message to the ref_counter is
delayed for an extremely long time or dropped entirely.

Previously the fold function was only invoked for leafs.
With this change it's possible to define a fold function which is called
for inner nodes and can return a tuple {skip, Acc} in order to skip

Commit message - Add configurable automatic compaction

A set of rules can now be defined in order to automatically
trigger the compaction of databases and their views. This
configuration can be global or overrided for specific
databases. By default it's disabled. Enabling it can be
done via the .ini configuration by simply adding global
or database specific compaction rules.

Commit message - Fix CouchJS compatibility with older Spidermonkey.

The recent patch to enable support for SM 1.8.5 broke support for
1.7.0. This patch updates couchjs to work with all of the major
variants of Spidermonkey.

Versions tested:

    1.7.0
    1.8.0rc1
    1.8.5
    1.9.2.something (XULRunner)

Various combinations have been tested on OS X, Ubuntu, FreeBSD and
Windows.

Fixes COUCHDB-1260

Commit message - Handle rexi_DOWN and rexi_EXIT messages

The controllers now subscribe to rexi_DOWN messages via rexi_monitor.
When a controller receives a message indicating that the rexi_server on
a node is down it assumes all the workers that were supposed to be
spawned by that server are dead.

This patch also adds clauses to handle rexi_EXIT events in a few
coordinators where they were missing.

The db_create and db_delete handlers are not modified by this patch.
We'll deal with them separately as we plan to make some larger-scale
changes to the algorithm there.

Commit message - Fix issue #15 .

Add support for internal `[integer(), binary()]` form of the sequence in
fabric_view_changes:unpack_seqs/2 .

Passing the internal form to since in fabric:changes/4 was causing the
error for some values. This patch fix it.

Commit message - Make clustered update_seq sort correctly

The CouchDB replicator gets confused when it sees an update sequence
of "100-" follow "99-" as it's treated as a string (where CouchDB uses
integers). This commit changes the format to [integer(), binary()]
which sort correctly.

The revised regular expression matches both the old and new update_seq
pattern. It is anchored at the end of the string and ignores any
trailing quotation marks and right brackets (which are present when
the replicator passes an update_seq as a string). It then greedily
matches all consecutive base64 (url-encoded variant) characters.

didn't provide it.  This patch changes the get_missing_revs
specification to return the possible ancestors, so other consumers
(e.g., _missing_revs) will need to be updated.

Restores replication compatibility with Apache CouchDB trunk and the
Couchbase 2.0 Preview.

BugzID: 12352
---> The original commit sha is - f00ee5d3a1b0adf4b2219f073d619fbdc3455572
Commit message - Use a simple majority for read and write requests

By default, wait to hear from N / 2 + 1 replicas of each
shard before responding. This ensures read-your-writes consistency
in most cases, particularly where N is not the default value 3.

Commit message - Fix sync triggers based on nodeup/nodedown events

Two bugs are fixed here.  The gen_event manager in which the mem3_sync
event handler is installed was not registered to receive nodeup and
nodedown messages.  But even if it had been registered, the messages
would have been ignored because the event handler was looking for them
in handle_event, not handle_info.

quite backy and would prefer to replace it with something based on
top-level keylists.

Commit message - Fix function_clause error on _revs_diff endpoint

The _revs_diff implementation in chttpd called get_missing_revs
expecting a list of possible ancestors for each Id/Rev pair, but we
didn't provide it.  This patch changes the get_missing_revs
specification to return the possible ancestors, so other consumers
(e.g., _missing_revs) will need to be updated.

Restores replication compatibility with Apache CouchDB trunk and the
Couchbase 2.0 Preview.

Commit message - Fix sync triggers based on nodeup/nodedown events

Two bugs are fixed here.  The gen_event manager in which the mem3_sync
event handler is installed was not registered to receive nodeup and
nodedown messages.  But even if it had been registered, the messages
would have been ignored because the event handler was looking for them
in handle_event, not handle_info.

Commit message - Fix sync triggers based on nodeup/nodedown events

Two bugs are fixed here.  The gen_event manager in which the mem3_sync
event handler is installed was not registered to receive nodeup and
nodedown messages.  But even if it had been registered, the messages
would have been ignored because the event handler was looking for them
in handle_event, not handle_info.

Commit message - Support custom IO priority in #view_query_args.extra

Still need support in _changes. I think the recname.extra approach is
quite backy and would prefer to replace it with something based on
top-level keylists.

in handle_event, not handle_info.

Commit message - Fix sync triggers based on nodeup/nodedown events

Two bugs are fixed here.  The gen_event manager in which the mem3_sync
event handler is installed was not registered to receive nodeup and
nodedown messages.  But even if it had been registered, the messages
would have been ignored because the event handler was looking for them
in handle_event, not handle_info.

Commit message - Revert "add cluster constants to db_info"

This reverts commit 5c55693bfef1c508ce37a4f6f278859686e3e968 which
broke replication between CouchDB and BigCouch.  CouchDB's replicator
uses list_to_existing_atom/1 on the keys of the DB info object, and it
hasn't seen the atoms 'n' and 'q' yet.

Commit message - Fix sync triggers based on nodeup/nodedown events

Two bugs are fixed here.  The gen_event manager in which the mem3_sync
event handler is installed was not registered to receive nodeup and
nodedown messages.  But even if it had been registered, the messages
would have been ignored because the event handler was looking for them
in handle_event, not handle_info.

Commit message - Fix sync triggers based on nodeup/nodedown events

Two bugs are fixed here.  The gen_event manager in which the mem3_sync
event handler is installed was not registered to receive nodeup and
nodedown messages.  But even if it had been registered, the messages
would have been ignored because the event handler was looking for them
in handle_event, not handle_info.

Commit message - Fix sync triggers based on nodeup/nodedown events

Two bugs are fixed here.  The gen_event manager in which the mem3_sync
event handler is installed was not registered to receive nodeup and
nodedown messages.  But even if it had been registered, the messages
would have been ignored because the event handler was looking for them
in handle_event, not handle_info.
