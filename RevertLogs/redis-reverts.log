Commit message - Fix configEpoch assignment when a cluster slot gets "closed".

This is still code to rework in order to use agreement to obtain a new
configEpoch when a slot is migrated, however this commit handles the
special case that happens when the nodes are just started and everybody
has a configEpoch of 0. In this special condition to have the maximum
configEpoch is not enough as the special epoch 0 is not unique (all the
others are).

This does not fixes the intrinsic race condition of a failover happening
while we are resharding, that will be addressed later.

If we don't have any clue about a master since it never replied to INFO
so far, reply with an -IDONTKNOW error to SENTINEL

Commit message - Sentinel: IDONTKNOW error removed.

This error was conceived for the older version of Sentinel that worked
via master redirection and that was not able to get configuration
updates from other Sentinels via the Pub/Sub channel of masters or
slaves.

This reply does not make sense today, every Sentinel should reply with
the best information it has currently. The error will make even more
sense in the future since the plan is to allow Sentinels to update the
configuration of other Sentinels via gossip with a direct chat without
the prerequisite that they have at least a monitored instance in common.

bind, otherwise connections will be accepted from all the interfaces in
both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.

Commit message - Revert "use long long instead of size_t make it more safe"

This reverts commit 2c75f2cf1aa0d9cc8256517bd6f3d8a82088ee1a.

After further analysis, it is very unlikely that we'll raise the
string size limit to > 512MB, and at the same time such big strings
will be used in 32 bit systems.

Better to revert to size_t so that 32 bit processors will not be
forced to use a 64 bit counter in normal operations, that is currently
completely useless.

Commit message - Scripting: redis.NIL to return nil bulk replies.

Lua arrays can't contain nil elements (see
http://www.lua.org/pil/19.1.html for more information), so Lua scripts
were not able to return a multi-bulk reply containing nil bulk
elements inside.

This commit introduces a special conversion: a table with just
a "nilbulk" field set to a boolean value is converted by Redis as a nil
bulk reply, but at the same time for Lua this type is not a "nil" so can
be used inside Lua arrays.

This type is also assigned to redis.NIL, so the following two forms
are equivalent and will be able to return a nil bulk reply as second
element of a three elements array:

    EVAL "return {1,redis.NIL,3}" 0
    EVAL "return {1,{nilbulk=true},3}" 0

The result in redis-cli will be:

    1) (integer) 1
    2) (nil)
    3) (integer) 3

Commit message - Bug fix: slaves being pinged every second

REDIS_REPL_PING_SLAVE_PERIOD controls how often the master should
transmit a heartbeat (PING) to its slaves.  This period, which defaults
to 10, is measured in seconds.

Redis 2.4 masters used to ping their slaves every ten seconds, just like
it says on the tin.

The Redis 2.6 masters I have been experimenting with, on the other hand,
ping their slaves *every second*.  (master_last_io_seconds_ago never
approaches 10.)  I think the ping period was inadvertently slashed to
one-tenth of its nominal value around the time REDIS_HZ was introduced.
This commit reintroduces correct ping schedule behaviour.

Commit message - Revert "Use the new install script as make install target. Message about install script requiring root changed a bit to make it more evident."
After talking with Pieter he changed my mind about this, it is better to
have a simpler install script that works everywhere, and the complex one
can be always executed if needed by hand. We'll make possibly a new
target for the full featured installation script, and even suggest it
after a Make install.
